Identity Theory 

Kripke, *Naming and Necessity*, 1972

>The trouble is that the identity theorist does not hold that the physical state merely produces the mental state, rather he wishes the two to be identical and thus a fortiori necessarily co-occurrent. In the case of molecular motion and heat there is something, namely, the sensation of heat, which is an intermediary between the external phenomenon and the observer. In the mental-physical case no such intermediary is possible, since here the physical phenomenon is supposed to be identical with the internal phenomenon itself. Someone can be in the same epistemic situation as he would be if there were heat, even in the absence of heat, simply by feeling the sensation of heat; and even in the presence of heat, he can have the same evidence as he would have in the absence of heat simply by lacking the sensation S. No such possibility exists in the case of pain and other mental phenomena. To be in the same episternic situation that would obtain if one had a pain is to have a pain; to be in the same epistemic situation that would obtain in the absence of a pain is not to have a pain. The apparent contingency of the connection between the mental state and the corresponding brain state thus cannot be explained by some sort of qualitative analogue as in the case of heat.

Kripke argues that the heat as molecular motion or lightning as electrical discharge analogies for mental states like pain are not the whole story because what doesn't compute is the *experience* of heat, lightning, or pain. Something can be hot without being felt as such, but nothing can be pain(ed, ful, etc) without being felt. The experience of pain (fear, etc) must be mediated by a feeling being. 

>God had to do some work, in addition to making the man himself, to make a certain man be the inventor of bifocals; the man could well exist without inventing any such thing. 

This line of Kripke's I don't find very persuasive. The epistemic conditions do not imply ontological ones (like Rorty says). The man who invented bifocals is Bejamin Franklin, and I might know him as one, both, or neither. This is still the same man regardless of my epistemic condition. There is no ontological distinction between these men, even if he had not invented anything! This might sound bold, but in my view this analogy is flawed.

J.J.C Smart, *Sensations and Brain Processes*, 1959 

>...when I "report" a pain, I am not really reporting anything (or, if you like, I am reporting in a queer sense of "reporting"), but am doing a sophisticated sort of wince.

Smart follows Wittgenstein here. 

>I wish to resist saying "I have a yellowish orange after-image" is to report something irreducibly psychical.
Why do I wish to resist this suggestion? Mainly because of Occam's razor. It seems to me that science is increasingly giving us a viewpoint whereby organisms are able to be seen as physico-chemical mechanisms: 4 it seems that even the behavior of man himself will one day be explicable in mechanistic terms. There does seem to be, so far as science is concerned, nothing in the world but increasingly complex arrangements of physical constituents. All except for one place: in consciousness. That is, for a full description of what is going on in a man you would have to mention not only the physical processes in his tissue, glands, nervous system, and so forth, but also his states of consciousness: his visual, auditory, and tactual sensations, his aches and pains. That these should be correlated with brain processes does not help, for to say that they are correlated is to say that they are something "over and above." You cannot correlate something with itself. 

I find these lines very compelling. I know there is more to the story here, but it is a good start. Kripke's problems still hold, as Smart cannot hold up his physical analogies and easily brush off internal *feels*. 

>...roughly, biology is to physics as radio-engineering is to electro-magnetism) except the occurrence of sensations seems to me to be frankly unbelievable. Such sensations would be "nomological danglers," to use Feigl's expression.

It's tough to hold up such a blatant reductionism these days, but I do understand the urge to limit any dangling. 

>I find Wittgenstein's position (as I construe it) congenial. For on this view there are, in a sense, no sensations. A man is a vast arrangement of physical particles, but there are not, over and above this, sensations or states of consciousness. There are just behavioral facts about this vast mechanism, such as that it ex- presses a temptation (behavior disposition) to say "there is a yellowish-red patch on the wall" or that it goes through a sophisticated sort of wince, that is, says "I am in pain." Admittedly Wittgenstein says that though the sensation "is not a something," it is nevertheless "not a noth- ing either" (paragraph 304), but this need only mean that the word "ache" has a use. An ache is a thing, but only in the innocuous sense in which the plain man, in the first paragraph of Frege's Foundations o f Arithmetic, answers the question "what is the number one?" by "a thing."

>Sensations are nothing over and above brain processes. Nations are nothing "over and above" citizens, but this does not prevent the logic of nation statements being very different from the logic of citizen statements, nor does it insure the translatability of nation statements into citizen statements. (I do not, however, wish to assert that the relation of sensation statements to brain-process statements is very like that of nation statements to citizen statements. Nations do not just happen to be nothing over and above citizens, for example. I bring in the "nations" example merely to make a negative point: that the fact that the logic of A-statements is differ- ent from that of B-statements does not insure that A's are anything over and above B's.)

>When I say that the successful general is the same person as the small boy who stole the apples I mean only that the successful general I see before me is a time sliceS of the same four-dimensional object of which the small boy stealing apples is an earlier time slice. However, the four-dimensional ob- ject which has the general-I-see-before-me for its late time slice is identical in the strict sense with the four-dimensional object which has the small-boy-stealing-apples for an early time slice. I distinguish these two senses of "is iden- tical with" because I wish to make it clear that the brain-process doctrine asserts identity in the strict sense.

What does Parfit do with this line of thinking? 

>The sense-datum, or at least the having of the sense-datum, the "look" of lightning, may well in my view be a correlate of the electric discharge. For in my view it is a brain state caused by the lightning. But we should no more confuse sensations of lightning with lightning than we confuse sensations of a table with the table. [...] An illiterate peasant might well be able to talk about his sensations without knowing about his brain processes, just as he can talk about lightning though he knows nothing of electricity.

It seems to me that this Wittgenstein view can indeed take us a long way, and it means something for neuroscience. What is this language game? Let's put aside the question for the moment of how brains process language, let's assume that they have a black box machine for turning words into brain states. It is more interesting to ask why certain words developed, namely these internal state words (pain, love, fear). Every brain is different in every time instant. These words are containers of similarity for communicating brains. Abstraction is the ability to generalize similarity, to inhibit concreteness. 

>Fido theory of meaning. If the mean- ing of an expression were what the expression named, then of course it would follow from the fact that "sensation" and "brain-process" have different meanings that they cannot name one and the same thing.

Smart makes mention of generalizations or "secondary properties": 

>This account of secondary qualities explains their unimpor- tance in physics. For obviously the discrimina- tions and lack of discriminations made by a very complex neurophysiological mechanism are hardly likely to correspond to simple and nonar- bitrary distinctions in nature.

>Raw feels, in my view, are colorless for the very same rea- son that something is colorless.

Communication, Smart says, works like:

>*There is some- thing going on which is like what is going on when...*

>So far we have not given sense to talk of experi- ences as swift or slow, straight or circular. But I am not claiming that "experience" and "brain- process" mean the same or even that they have the same logic. 

>The language of introspective reports has a different logic from the language of material processes. It is obvious that until the brain-process theory is much improved and widely accepted there will be no criteria for saying "Smith has an experience of such-and- such a sort" except Smith's introspective re- ports. So we have adopted a rule of language that (normally) what Smith says goes.

>*I can imagine myself turned to stone and yet having images, aches, pains, and so on.* All the objection shows is that "experi- ence" and "brain-process" do not have the same meaning. It does not show that an experience is not in fact a brain process.

>The issue between the brain-process theory and epiphenomenalism seems to be of the above sort. (Assuming that a behavioristic reduction of introspective reports is not possible.) If it be agreed that there are no cogent philosophical ar- guments which force us into accepting dualism, and if the brain process theory and dualism are equally consistent with the facts, then the prin- ciples of parsimony and simplicity seem to me to decide overwhelmingly in favor of the brain- process theory. As I pointed out earlier, dualism involves a large number of irreducible psy- chophysical laws (whereby the "nomological danglers" dangle) of a queer sort, that just have to be taken on trust, and are just as difficult to swallow as the irreducible facts about the pale- ontology of the earth with which we are faced on Philip Gosse's theory.
