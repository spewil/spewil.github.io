Functionalism 

<br><br>

There are three types of functions: bijective, injective, and surjective, where a function is defined as a mapping between one set and another.

Hilary Putnam, *The Nature of Mental States*, 1973 

>The view that concepts (intensions) are the same as properties has been explicitly ad- vocated by Carnap (e.g., in Meaning and Neces- sity). This seems an unfortunate view, since "temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy" appears to be a perfectly good example of a true statement of identity of properties, whereas "the concept of temperature is the same concept as the concept of mean molecular kinetic energy" is simply false.

The distinction between *property* and *concept* is a useful and interesting one.
