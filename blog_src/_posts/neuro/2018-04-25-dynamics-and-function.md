my dream is to apply neural organizational principles to understanding how people/groups organize
like applying natural structure to human structure

this structure is the system-- i'm worried because i don't want to invest because it's a system that perpetuates oppression and inequality 

this is the structure, this is the framework in which decisions are made. the anatomy of the brain is not static. it changes genetically, over evolutionary time scales, and the functional goings-on changes on many faster time scales of various length

the differences between how and why and what in neuroscience

how did google grow? first a tech, then decision to use ads 

have to change how people thinkâ€” metaphors and paradigms of thinking e.g. OO operating system? interacting objects with files, etc? each project is a module?
