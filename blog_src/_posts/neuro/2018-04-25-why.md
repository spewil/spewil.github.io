why study neuroscience? to move towards a hughter reason-- to communicate something to pepole about themselves 

>It’s not to psychoanalysis or linguistics but to the biology of the brain that we should look for principles, because it doesn’t have the drawback, like the other two disciplines, of drawing on ready-made concepts. We can consider the brain as a relatively undifferentiated mass and ask what circuits . . . the movement-image or the time-image trace out, or invent, because the circuits aren’t there to begin with.

>Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as "buggery (enculage)", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.

>Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls "percepts" and "affects"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero (which Deleuze calls "functives"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:[35] they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, "separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another."[36] For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time.[37] Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as "is it true?" or "what is it?", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: "what does it do?" or "how does it work?"

>Deleuze’s key ideas. There is, for example, his famous point that philosophy is the creation of concepts. Without the creation of new concepts, there can be no thinking with a difference, no line of flight in thought. Second, and closely related to this, Deleuze proposed that concepts are tools of analysis, not recognition.

they still get stuck on duality
the main reason, and to me the most interesting reason, is that we cant let go of our mental vocabulary
because its not just semantic (i think) like "eliminative" materialists would say, they would eliminate that language in favor of "weakened feedback from cortex to basal ganglion 17" or whatever
so it feels cheap to me to say "it is us"
i mean it is! who could argue that
it's about making an eloquent argument for why we have these words, and why we have commonalities
souls, thoughts, mental images, sadness
its as cheap to say "they dont exist _really_"
as it is to say "they just _are_"
but its not right to ask "_what_ are they"
i think it's much more interesting/productive/fun to ask "_why_ are they"

what is pre-screen society? apart from metaphors, how has our experience changed?

I met two film students, they were excited to think that their form, as opposed to the scientific mode, was held in equal esteem.

what questions? 

how is the brain organized? how does the structure of the brain give rise to complex computations? 
how does the brain control itself, or how is it controlled by phenomena/sensation? 

my dream is to apply neural organizational principles to understanding how people/groups organize
like applying natural structure to human structure

this structure is the system-- i'm worried because i don't want to invest because it's a system that perpetuates oppression and inequality 

this is the structure, this is the framework in which decisions are made. the anatomy of the brain is not static. it changes genetically, over evolutionary time scales, and the functional goings-on changes on many faster time scales of various length

the differences between how and why and what in neuroscience

how did google grow? first a tech, then decision to use ads 

have to change how people think— metaphors and paradigms of thinking e.g. OO operating system? interacting objects with files, etc? each project is a module?
