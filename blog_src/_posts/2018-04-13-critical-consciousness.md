i went for [a walk in holland](https://walkofwisdom.org/2018/onze-eerste-pelgrims-uit-amerika/) and i hope to go on this [2800 mile walk](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/02/england-coast-path-2020-norfolk-walking-holidays) in england soon... i realized on my walk that walking is so fundamentally human that to leave it out of our rituals is to deprive ourselves of our selves.

i'm thinking about communalism and [milk kinship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_kinship) is a fascinating example of the embodied politic

>Noble offspring were often sent to milk kin fosterers that would foster them to maturity so that the children would be raised by their successive status subordinates. The purpose of this was for political importance to build milk kin as bodyguards.

[why doesn't mentoring work?](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/corporate-mentorship-programs/528927/) from the atlantic 

>There are many problems with the existing model of corporate mentorship, says Jennifer Labin, the principal partner of TERP Associates, a firm that specializes in creating public- and private-sector mentoring programs. “Mentoring programs have become this band-aid,” Labin says. She adds that, in her experience, programs are often “thrown together by overworked, overwhelmed people who’ve never built mentoring programs.” Many people in these roles have often never even been mentored themselves, according to Labin.

>In the book Intelligent Mentoring, by Audrey Murrell, Sheila Forte-Trammel, and Diana Bing, the authors assert that the more traditional approach to mentoring—in which an older (and often white and male) senior employee chooses a younger (and often white and male) protégé to take beneath his wing—is outdated. The main reason this is the case is that one-on-one mentoring was pioneered during a time when it was normal for people to stay in the same full-time job, at the same organization, for years—if not their entire career.

>Researchers have established that negative mentoring experiences caused more intense emotional and behavioral responses among employees compared to positive incidents.

>...it’s hard to fix mentoring programs if employers don’t ask for feedback and employees don’t tell them what’s wrong. And that may be the case in many places. When I reached out to a group of elite, professional women about their experiences with workplace-based mentoring, hardly anyone volunteered to share stories on the record, for fear of professional blowback. One woman simply wrote, “Try to avoid formal programs at all costs. Torture.” The key to creating better mentorship programs, Labin said, is to be more thoughtful in the planning stages.
