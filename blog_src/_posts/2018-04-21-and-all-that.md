a confessional blog post about [getting your attention back](https://craigmod.com/essays/how_i_got_my_attention_back/)

>In “Gravity and Grace,” Simone Weil writes, “Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes faith and love.” Then is the lack of attention the opposite? Does it presuppose fear and hate?

>In shopping mall design, [the Gruen transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer) (also known as the Gruen effect) is the moment when consumers enter a shopping mall or store and, surrounded by an intentionally confusing layout, lose track of their original intentions, making consumers more susceptible to make impulse buys.

interview with [young dirty bastard](https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/rgwz3r/meet-young-dirty-bastard-son-of-ol-dirty-bastard)

>I’m rapping cause I’m hungry and my father’s not here and they don’t want me doing this. I’m only doing it because I wanna be on stage, and my mother wants me on stage, she’d kick my ass if I wasn’t. We need every nickel and dime. Shit, we might get kicked out of the house right now!

>We always had food stamps, food stamps is what we need. Some people don’t need em. But if food stamps weren’t there, I couldn’t be rapping. I gotta provide for my family. Babies gotta eat, G. It’s real. That’s how I’m standing, my momma fed me. We need food stamps, Government! Fuck Republicans.

[story for change](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/using_story_to_change_systems)

>[...] tackling problems like climate change, inequality, and health care requires a systems approach. The work of systems change involves seeing systemically—looking at the elements, interconnections, and wider purposes of systems—and acting systemically. Story plays a vital role in helping us do both of these things.

>Story has many different qualities that make it useful for the work of systems change. It’s a direct route to our emotions, and therefore important to decision-making. It creates meaning out of patterns. It coheres communities. It engenders empathy across difference. It enables the possible to feel probable in ways our rational minds can’t comprehend. When it comes to changing the values, mindsets, rules, and goals of a system, story is foundational.

one thing to remember in this story as light, story as glue, story as web is that these same tools can (and are) used all the time for detrimental purposes, to alter oppressive narratives to adapt to new alternatives. narratives are only positive if they are conversations, not lectures... 
 
>"Any large-scale human cooperation—whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe—is rooted in common myths that only exist in people’s collective imagination.” <br> -Yuval Noah Harari 

>- Change the personal narratives we have about our lives.
- Change the cultural narratives that frame the issues we advocate for.
- Change the mythic narratives that influence our worldview.

[systems thinking for large-scale change:](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/solving_the_worlds_biggest_problems_better_philanthropy_through_systems_cha)

> - Think in systems. Having a great idea for solving a social problem is just the beginning. You also need to identify the collaborators who can help you translate your innovation into real solutions for the real world.
- Engage in research and analysis to hone your strategy. Figure out what’s really needed—and what works. 
- Understand that effective communication is the lifeblood of any systems change campaign. Maintain transparent and compelling communications both internally with collaborative partners, and externally with public audiences. 
- Embrace your inner policy wonk—and your inner politico. If you seek to change a complex system, you will often need to change the laws, administrative rules, and official practices governing that system.
- Measure and evaluate. Then measure and evaluate again. The most successful systems change campaigns create consistent and ongoing data assessments, and rely upon those findings to guide strategy and ensure accountability.
