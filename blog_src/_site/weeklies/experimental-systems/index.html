<blockquote>
  <p>Experimental systems are precautions taken for the generation of spontaneous events. One has to look at them as places of emergence, as structures that have arisen from the development of the sciences in order to discover the unimaginable. They act like a spider web, in that they need to be able to catch everything, without the knowledge of what it is or where it comes from. It is an ensemble that is constantly under configuration and re-configuration, but is not systematically assembled as e.g. a car, in which every part is built to fit the next for it to work. Indeed, the process exists because there is no working car!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think artistic work is a practical way of relating to the world and just as activity driven as the sciences. In both cases, it is about pioneering the unknown: a step closer in exploring a topic, of which one does not yet know much. Therefore, the execution of research and the execution of artistic work are generally comparable activities. One engages oneself in an adventure with an uncertain outcome. […] Both are not to be understood as a teleological process, but rather the rejection of a current state, which leaves much to be desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the age of eighteen, I have been writing and never stopped, although I have also never made it my profession. The point for me, is not to express my innermost feelings, but to engage with a different material, namely language and words, and these can be very resistant. How they are arranged and what can be created with them are materially contingent processes to me. At their very end, things emerge, which one would not have thought of in the beginning, as they configure and originate only in the concrete handling of the word material.</p>

<p>I would love to see those poems.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/">There’s no free will.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Further studies by Baumeister and colleagues have linked a diminished belief in free will to stress, unhappiness, and a lesser commitment to relationships. They found that when subjects were induced to believe that “all human actions follow from prior events and ultimately can be understood in terms of the movement of molecules,” those subjects came away with a lower sense of life’s meaningfulness. Early this year, other researchers published a study showing that a weaker belief in free will correlates with poor academic performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s more, Harris argues, as ordinary people come to better understand how their brains work, many of the problems documented by Vohs and others will dissipate. Determinism, he writes in his book, does not mean “that conscious awareness and deliberative thinking serve no purpose.” Certain kinds of action require us to become conscious of a choice—to weigh arguments and appraise evidence. True, if we were put in exactly the same situation again, then 100 times out of 100 we would make the same decision, “just like rewinding a movie and playing it again.” But the act of deliberation—the wrestling with facts and emotions that we feel is essential to our nature—is nonetheless real.</p>

<p>More on this soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">Tardigrades</a>, AKA water bears, are virtually indestructible little creatures. I’m really curious about their brains.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>After thinking about where to by ecological cycling gear, it turns out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/cyclists-sustainable-ethical-cycling-gear-helmets-saddle">cycling sustainability</a> is an interesting question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Former professional cyclist Francesca Barsamian says “durability and functionality is much more important to me than sustainability. All my accessories get heavy use and I have to know they’ll last. But because of that, I don’t buy things that often.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end it comes down to consumer choice, the most powerful tool in the marketplace…</p>

<p><a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/6345/do-photons-interact-with-each-other-or-with-themselves-only">Peter Shor learns about photon-photon interactions.</a> I really admire this humility.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>I’m now fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System">tariff codes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The HS is organized into 21 sections, which are subdivided into 96 chapters. The 96 HS chapters are further subdivided into approximately 5,000 headings and subheadings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By my count, that’s 10,080,000 codes. Whoa.</p>
