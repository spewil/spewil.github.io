Hi, I'm spencer.

I'm an engineer and a scientist too.

Currently a phd student at the <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/swc" target="_new">sainsbury wellcome center</a>, I'm using reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction to understand how brains solve high-dimensional coordination problems. You can read (and comment on!) my online thesis <a href="https://www.spewil.com/phd/" target="_blank">here</a>.
