# hodology

I’ve learned today that hodology is the study of pathways. The word derives from the Greek hodos, meaning "path”, the study of paths. This can be applied to cartography and to neuroscience equally. As all modern things, each -ology has been splintered and fractured and specialized, but my belief remains that we can incorporate many of the frontiers of human thought into a widespread hodology. Understanding the connections between objects at all levels of hierarchy is key to understand systems. I think that by advancing the esoteric realms of graph theory into the common scientific understanding, we will all become more aware of our connections and their significance. 

The second part returns to the question of what liberals do. There was a great article in the Atlantic yesterday When America Went Haywire that offers some help moving forward in time: 

>We must call out the dangerously untrue and unreal. A grassroots movement against one kind of cultural squishiness has taken off and lately reshaped our national politics—the opposition to political correctness. I envision a comparable struggle that insists on distinguishing between the factually true and the blatantly false.

This still doesn’t tell us how in fact to achieve this. My best idea so far is to take a cue from the BBC. What happened to PBS? Are people so profit-driven that they can’t put the need to educate a country with objective information and culture before making money? In fact, I know they are, so what is the solution to that problem? It’s a cycle, the more cutthroat capitalistic we become, the less “good” public options are available, and the competitive edge sharpens— the hierarchy steepens. 

>It will require a struggle to make America reality-based again. Fight the good fight in your private life. You needn’t get into an argument with the stranger at Chipotle who claims that George Soros and Uber are plotting to make his muscle car illegal—but do not give acquaintances and friends and family members free passes. If you have children or grandchildren, teach them to distinguish between true and untrue as fiercely as you do between right and wrong and between wise and foolish.

We have to do more than this. While I agree that fighting personal battles isn’t the answer, fighting intellectual wars is. Risk your income, your job, your lifestyle, for your country’s—no, humanity’s— future. If you want to believe something, believe in humanity, in the compassion that we are capable of fostering in ourselves and in others. 

>We need to adopt new protocols for information-media hygiene. Would you feed your kids a half-eaten casserole a stranger handed you on the bus, or give them medicine you got from some lady at the gym?

Yes. This. Now. How? Government intervention for God’s sake! 

>And fight the good fight in the public sphere. One main task, of course, is to contain the worst tendencies of Trumpism, and cut off its political-economic fuel supply, so that fantasy and lies don’t turn it into something much worse than just nasty, oafish, reality-show pseudo-conservatism. Progress is not inevitable, but it’s not impossible, either.
