But 
all we have 
our bodies ask
how many stints 
can be placed 
how delicate 
are fingers

I haven't seen 
any in a week
only videos 
hanging dark inverted 
all we have 
are bodies 
feeling physical 
thinking in objects 
repetitions and walking 

they flew upward through
summer on the balcony--  
balconies aren't safe-- 
that door is locked 

all we got 
were bodies
