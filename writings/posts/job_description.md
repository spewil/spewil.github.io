# Job Description 

Chet works in Arkansas pumping gas into pressed-steel jalopies  	
	one night he found his ceramic teeth shattered on the asphalt 	
	a trumpeter who lost his embouchure, lost his arms, lost supreme love

build a cathedral alone in darkness, bathe in emptiness
	learn the shadowÕs long history steeped in leaves of stone 
	watch bricks crumble under self weight alone

build a greenhouse-- trap light, trap rain-- burn windÕs invitation 
	let fire rage, let smoke pour from crucible eyes
	watch the building crumble again 

play surveyor, look through dreamglass, tumble dry identity
	sit, hear every voice all at once scream silent 
	fold the wind into a garment held out for arms 

learn architecture, new knowledge for kicking dust into flame 
	kick dusk into eyes, feel pain-- develop democracy, place in gilt frame
	draw nude in oils, gaze, feel the act of difference, march through rain

embrace immense solitude, horizon dimlit with diffuse light 
	seek faces with thoughts, seek details, recollect reality in paint
	light nests, light houses-- country, empty space  

tarnish walls with inscription, play inimitable source 
	cigarette burn film, use hand-me-down equipment 
	let eyes age and celluloid wait in blue darkness

fall in love with spires, fall in love with eggshells 
	fall in love with birds and with mollusks
	with metal and with skin 

I found a position as an Anglepoise lamp
crystalline and taut, forever adjustable 
watching a stranger cry through the window of my church 
a person speaks to my refuge from a snow-white television 
I see how a building begins and how it can end
