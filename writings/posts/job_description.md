# Job Description 

Chet works in Arkansas pumping gas into pressed-steel jalopies  	
&ensp; one night he found his ceramic teeth shattered on the asphalt 	
&ensp; a trumpeter who lost his embouchure, lost his arms, lost supreme love

build a cathedral alone in darkness, bathe in emptiness
&ensp; learn the shadow's long history steeped in leaves of stone 
&ensp; watch bricks crumble under self weight alone

build a greenhouse-- trap light, trap rain-- burn wind's invitation 
&ensp; let fire rage, let smoke pour from crucible eyes
&ensp; watch the building crumble again 

play surveyor, look through dreamglass, tumble dry identity
&ensp; sit, hear every voice all at once scream silent 
&ensp; fold the wind into a garment held out for arms 

learn architecture, new knowledge for kicking dust into flame 
&ensp; kick dusk into eyes, feel pain-- develop democracy, place in gilt frame
&ensp; draw nude in oils, gaze, feel the act of difference, march through rain

embrace immense solitude, horizon dimlit with diffuse light 
&ensp; seek faces with thoughts, seek details, recollect reality in paint
&ensp; light nests, light houses-- country, empty space  

tarnish walls with inscription, play inimitable source 
&ensp; cigarette burn film, use hand-me-down equipment 
&ensp; let eyes age and celluloid wait in blue darkness

fall in love with spires, fall in love with eggshells 
&ensp; fall in love with birds and with mollusks
&ensp; with metal and with skin 

I found a position as an Anglepoise lamp
crystalline and taut, forever adjustable 
watching a stranger cry through the window of my church 
a person speaks to my refuge from a snow-white television 
I see how a building begins and how it can end
