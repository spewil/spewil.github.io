# economy of scale 

sitting on the third floor balcony
i peer over the edge into the back garden
looking at myself lying broken on the deck

upward over the zigzag roofs
diagonal nets of birds
fly in disparate formation

beyond those another flight takes off 
smaller than flapping wings
a rigid container of more 

context is necessary to remain grounded 
elevation is truth to maintain truth 
to contain every single thought 

each bird could be rigid
every wing could be hapless
but where would we go from there

how many thoughts can be contained 
in a steel tube, metallic strength 
whispers on clouds never known 

the gutters run parallel to thought
from top until bottom 
moss grows around their exits 

each lichen its own world
every feather meant for flight
but where would you go from there

who contains you?
what forces compel us to move 
together, within our own flocks 

of ceaseless flights
of pouring wastewater
of endless sight 
near and far
