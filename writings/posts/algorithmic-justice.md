the fourth amendment reads:

>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

this statement requires a scrupulous definition of *probable*. will we need to quantify an upper bound on the variance of our parameters in order to enter someone's home?

the time for algorithmic society has come, the time is now for reflection and adjustment, a relaxation period. we have to contend with the state of the art. how will communities feel when they are targeted? how do we deal with historicism of data-centric tools? historicity is the kernel of data analysis, yet its flaw. the paradox of what will be, predicted by what was, consumed by stochasticity. if it worked we would all be rich. are we free to choose how we live? why not change things? 

if the past predicts the future, we must believe in determinism. we can clearly see that there is more to the narrative. the missing blank might be filled with something called "open-mindedness", however blasé. to construct a model is to construct a mind. if that mind can only see backwards, our destination is known and it is frightening.

Albert Einstein said 
>“If the moon, in the act of completing its eternal way around the earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would be fully convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord... So would a Being, endowed with higher insight and more perfect intelligence, watching man and his doings, smile about man’s illusion that he was acting according to his own free will”


Thomas Huxley said 
>“The feeling we call volition is not the cause of the voluntary act, but simply the symbol in consciousness of the stage of the brain which is the immediate cause of the act. Like the steam whistle which signals but doesn’t cause the starting of the locomotive”

those who hold so strongly onto religion and spirit have not seen the benevolence of the hammer. look only to the freedom imparted by its destructive effect: your shackles of choice are broken-- your spirit becomes your world. 

how can we jail a human being? how can we punish her? she is merely the instantiation of particles. what we know as stochastic or determined is merely the lens under which we investigate that which we cannot understand. the only duality is what we describe and what we are yet to know. placing a human into handcuffs is simply projecting the ideal of soul onto the corpus itself. the incarcerated is merely a symbol of spiritualism. vitalism is the producer of duality-- what is good and what is not so good.

inside the issue:
the impersonal nature of statistics
the paradox of determinism and individuality -- free agents and the atomistic views
the fallacy of sociophysics
the absurdity of quantitative sociodynamics, and hope for its transcendence 
how do we specialize? 
how do we generalize?

soon you will know how language will function here.

the use of fragments, until clusters connect, the correlation of ideas extends to infinity, thoughts percolate

this is the same phenomenon as when my mind stays awake longer than it should, my body succumbs to drowsiness. the same as when i drink wine when i return home, when i skip dinner, when i attempt to bake cookies and instead eat raw dough and inhale particulate. 

my body succumbs, only. my language consumes thought. i possess.  -->
