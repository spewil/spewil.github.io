# Travel

On January 7th at 4am, Sara and I awoke in a co-op house in Boston on a borrowed bed. I took a taxi to catch a flight out of Logan to Heathrow departing 8am. Strong crosswinds rattled the plane as it descended into London, landing with a 20 degree yaw angle. The sound of hundreds of hands gripping armrests reached my ears mixed with Sara’s snoring. I began reading Freud’s Dream Psychology during the two-hour layover in London. 

On the Flight to Delhi, I remained awake despite three nips of cheap red wine. Across the aisle, a man ordered bloody mary mix, “…or tomato juice is fine”. You want bloody mark mix? Yeah sure, he gets it. The man waits several minutes and waves down a different stewardess. In a proper British accent: “Yes, excuse me miss, you forgot the vodka in this.” The stewardness, embarrassed: “Oh, silly, that’s the most important bit, innit?” Free Bloody Mary, the bastard. I’ll remember that trick next time.  

On January 8th, Eight hours later, the plane landed in Delhi. Only one more flight to go, traveling to Pithampur. No wave of smell hit us, or a mob of people. We waited in lines for customs and lines for another security check. “You need the red bus, it's free with your most recent boarding pass.” Ambling outside, we spotted a bus for Terminal 1T. One foot hit the bus’s floor as it began moving. I looked up to a grinning bus driver with yellow eyes. Honking ensued; throngs of people scattered barely missed by the bus. They acted as if it didn’t exist. “That will be 25 rupee,” a man said, holding a wad of cash. Not the driver, mind you, just a man with a notepad, slacks, and a mustache. “No it's free with this,” I said. I hold out my boarding pass. Eyes on me, he mumbled in Hindi to his two henchmen. “You need free ticket.” “Well, I don’t have that, sorry.” A woman crouched beside a small fire in a ditch by the road. Behind her, a cement wall topped with coils of razor wire. Helmet-less motorcyclists weaved through traffic. The lines segregating the four lanes of the road are merely a suggestion. 

We were booted off the bus at a separate airport, this one for domestic airlines. After attempting to find the entrance, we asked a soldier holding a submachine gun. We walked to a small building nestled between hanger-like structures, up a few flights of stairs spotted with sleeping bodies, and reached the ticketing counter for our airline. After a bit of translation difficulty, I paid 50 rupee for a piece of paper with my flight receipt. We waited for the dot-matrix printer to output the file. We asked where we were meant to head next. “Outside. Go to left,” she said. Her slender brown finger pointed the way. 

We headed left until we hit a man with a larger gun, comfortably pointed at my head. I didn’t recognize the make, but the barrel and stock were worn, covered in scratches. “Go to terminal,” he said. He points to one of the larger hangers. A group of a dozen soldiers stood near us in a group, talking absentmindedly. They looked in our direction each time they stamped out a cigarette.

We walked inside and went to security. 
“No, you must have boarding pass, this is ticket.” 
We were shepherded to the check-in desk. 
“Put first bag on scale please.” 
"We’re just carrying on.” 
We pointed to our reasonably sized backpacks. 
“11 kilo limit put on scale please thank you.” 
We looked around, hoping he would ignore us. 
“Cannot get boarding pass without bag.” 
We placed the entirety of our earthly possessions on the conveyor belt and collected our passes.

Security was a male line and a female line, both leading to a metal detector, a pat down, and a detector wand. Women stand in have a curtained box marked “Ladies” in poor handwriting.

We waited for 5 hours in the Delhi airport eating "Magic India Masala" Lays chips. Chicken Tikka sandwiches, mango lassis. The crowds move together as a body, and the stairs are used primarily for lounging.

It was boarding time. Sara did not have her small bag stamped and ran back to security to procure it. She returned as the doors are closing and we are bused to the plane. The mist was thick, and there was a cold breeze as we boarded.

We arrive in Indore, a medium-sized city close to Pithampur. Our backpacks arrived as well. A sign in baggage claim says "NO SPITTING, NO SITTING". 

# First Drive

A driver from our community sponsor, Pinnacle Industries, waited for us outside. His name was Mr. Mahesh, a stout middle-aged man with a baseball hat permanently attached to his head, and a thin smile permanently held on his face. Our car, a Mahindra machine, departed on a paved road that soon turns to dirt. The car is worth roughly $2000, one of the most affordable cars in the world. It comes with zero amenities, and I stopped counting other Mahindras at twenty by the time we left the airport area. Mr. Mahesh's steering wheel has two worn patches around each horn button. The ride is complete with wandering cows with painted horns, men crouched around small fires, a beautiful sunset, and hundreds of flashed headlights and honks. The traffic rules, I soon learned, are twofold: assert dominance and pass frequently. We slowed through neighborhoods where people gazed at us through the windows of the car as we passed. 

![][image-1]

The trip to the factory took an hour from the Indore airport. “Are we close?” I asked. Mahesh smiled in the rearview and turned up the Bollywood soundtrack. Horns and drums bounced around in my head. Looking through the passenger window, I watched men with large turbans herd goats and sheep along the road's shoulder. Buildings stood unfinished twenty yards from the road, their concrete foundations holding up a cinder block first story. Dozens of long tree trunks supported the roof of the building's second story. This second story appeared to be a dense, barren forest. It seemed at any moment the wind would topple the trunks over and the building would collapse. Later, in Bangalore, I would see an identical construction practice in the upper floors of skyscrapers hundreds of feet in the air, the forest towering above the streets. Many of the homes along the drive to Pithampur were tin-roofed with trunks used as a permanent structural element. Large rocks held down the tin atop the single floored houses. Suddenly a large snap occurred from the windshield. We were passing through a small village with a single dirt throughway. A boy's kite was flapping like a dry fish against the windshield, its string caught in the wiper blade. Mahesh reach out of his driver's side window to untangle the string. Succeeding, the small homemade kite launched back into the air to the cheers of a crowd of boys. Their smiling faces moved past outside the car. A few miles ahead, we stopped for fifteen minute while a herd of cattle crossed the road. The herder was last to pass, and waved his staff slowly. He worn white blue jeans, slicked back hair, and a shining purple embroidered shirt. His staffless hand held a Samsung smartphone to his ear.

At the walled factory compound, small dusty kids played soccer in the shadows. They waited while our car passed through the gate, a slow-swinging, homegrown security measure employing a plastic bucket full of stones as a counterweight. Are they the children of the factory employees? They are likely neighborhood kids. 

![][image-3]

We headed to the office to send an email on an early 2000s Dell desktop and retired to the guesthouse. The house is a four-bedroom apartment on the ground floor of small six-story complex in the back corner of the compound. There we met Mr. Raji, a man with 45 years of manufacturing experience and an equally impressive mustache. His daughter, a doctor living in Australia, loves Bollywood and traditional dancing. Dinner with Mr. Raji in the guesthouse was a dal with rice and paneer. After dinner we were served masala chai before we collapsed, exhausted, into our beds.

# Factory

We were led on a tour of the Pinnacle factory, the largest maker of bus interiors in India. It was hot; steam rose out of potholes in the unmarked street outside the factory fence, and men wore cloth over their heads to wick their sweat. Groups of men wearing various pieces, some rags, of green canvas welding cloth stood around talking. Our presence hushed these groups, and we attracted stares. Our tour guide was knowledgeable though indecipherable. Most of our learning of the space was through his nouns: “Paint…weld…fabric…stamps…dies…bending…shipping…proto.”
Our guide dropped us at the last of these nouns, the “R&D” shop, meant for prototyping entire interiors to attract potential customers. Our goal was to implement a design change for our American sponsor, a folding wheelchair frame. The visual trumps the verbal. This shop is overstaffed and undersupplied, like most of India currently. Welding, grinding, all without safety equipment. Sparks flying, tools flying, a thick dust cloud hangs in the air. We replaced the tops on our water bottles before we set them down. Yelling in Hindi over the high decibels of machine tools. The shop is small, with two metal worktables. Men stand on the tables to weld in a better position. Some wear shoes. Every task requires several people: one to hold the tool and three others to yell at him and discuss his approach to the job. 

![][image-5]
![][image-6]
![][image-7]

After an hour of explaining our new designs, via our notebooks, teatime was called. All the men dropped their tools and wandered out into the overwhelming brightness, grabbing a small metal cup from a stack by the door. A small boy ran up the group of fifty sweating men and hoisted a large stainless steal carafe onto his bony shoulder. He yells at the men to form a queue for the drink while pouring exactly one cup’s worth into each or their vessels. The men hold the cups by the rim, the steam from the sand-colored liquid wetting their hands. After all the chai is drunk, the cups are splashed into a water pail that has appeared and are replaced. 

![][image-8]
![][image-9]

A recurring character in the R&D shop that day was a man wearing a purple vest containing a combination of sequins and faux-fur. When the man moved, the hairs moved in the opposite direction, and the sequins caught the sunlight from the barred windows of the workshop that looked out over a trash-filled lot. 
“He heard you were coming,” a voice said from behind. 
  
I turned to see a Bollywood star. His thick black hair is parted on the side and expertly combed over his square forehead into a reasonable pompadour. He held a clipboard, patting it against his jeans. 
“They heard the Americans were coming today, and they wore their best. Do you like Bruce Willis?” he asked. 
“Bruce Willis?” 
“You know, Die Hard. I watched this just last night,” he said.
“Sure, I like Die Hard. Which one did you watch?” I asked. 
“With a Vengeance, in New York City. The best. Do you like Tom Cruise?”
“Your English is very good.” I offered. 
He beamed and looked down at his feet, kicking a scrap of metal under the worktable. A welder heard the clink and looked at the man, bending to the scrap and placing it on the table. 
“Thank you, I was working for John Deere, you know this? American.”
“Yes, I know John Deere. That’s a good company.”
“Very good, the best. I work there as an engineer designing parts and now I am here as a manager. But,” he leaned in closer, “I have a company on the side. I am an entrepreneur. I wish to be a businessman.” 
His teeth were pearl white, and only one was slightly amiss. He leaned away and glanced around. 
“It sounds like you are well on your way. What do you do here?” I asked. 
In his glances, he caught something. He walked to a corner of the workshop and pointed at a man with his clipboard, yelling Hindi. The man explained his work, gesticulating wildly, and the manager held his hands behind him, rocking on his heels. The worker continued and the manager walked back to me. 
“So you like Tom Cruise?”
“Well, I—“
“Yes, he is great American actor. I hope to be like him one day” the manager responded. His strong chin conjured images of a Bollywood Jerry Maguire. 
“What is your name?”
“My name is Dee------,” he said, a grinder moving into a piece of metal just as he spoke his name, sparks flying into his jeans. He grabbed my shoulder and moved me away from the grinding. 
“It’s very nice to meet you,” I said. 
“And you. We will talk business soon,” he said winking and hurrying out of the shop, papers flapping from the clipboard. 

![][image-10]

A man, gloved and masked, ushered us to a pile of seat foam, shooing away the current occupants. 
“Sit, Ma’am, sit, sit.” 
He pointed to the foam. 
“Sit.” 
I sat. 


# Up the Food Chain

We needed to redesign an entire fixture setup to accommodate our new designs. We walked across the compound to the welding area, greeting workmen along the way. We reached a small man in his twenties, wearing white jeans and a striped shirt. His entire front was covered in green cloth, his face wrapped in a rag around his goggles, his head tied a red cloth. He was responsible for welding the current fixtures. He spoke no English. We smiled and pointed to the fixture and he beamed. We gave him a thumbs-up and he beamed, bouncing on his heels. He held his hands behind unless we offered a hand to shake. Soon, several other workers gathered for the embracing of their hands. Then, we met Mr. Millin. 

Mr. Millin is the manager responsible for most of the logistics in the welding area of the factory, and all of the welding for our wheelchair. He spoke little English. 
“We need to weld a new fixture for the set frame, one that has folding capabilities” I said. 
“Yes” he responded, wagging his head and staring at the current fixture on the floor. “Who can help us with this?” I asked. 
“Yes” he responded with more wagging. 
“Can you weld this for me?” I asked him. 
He looked up at me blankly, and back down at the fixture, and at the man with the red bandanna. 
“No.”
“Who can weld this for me?”
He looked puzzled scratching his bare chin, and asked the ceiling for an answer. He looked back at me suddenly and walked out of the room. I looked to the man with the red bandanna, who stood rocking and beaming. 
“Go!” he said. 

Mr. Millin led us to the main office and promptly left. We sat on a worn couch (manufacture a few hundred feet away). An old man sat behind a mismatched desk answering the phone when it occasionally rang. A portrait of a mustached man in a turban hung crookedly behind the secretary. People moved through the lobby, to the left and right, up the stairs behind the desk. Some glanced at us. The secretary eyed me, wagged his head, picked up the phone, said single phrase, and set down the receiver. A few minutes later, an older man carried a tray with small porcelain cups of chai. He lowered the tray to the secretary, to me, to Sara, and took a cup for himself. As we sat sipping, a woman swept the floor with a short straw broom. She crouched low on her heels, rotating on her feet one after the other. She made a large circuit, constantly sweeping the broom, never looking upward. 

“My friends!” This was Siddarth, our contact at Pinnacle that we had met over email. We shook hands lightly, his tall frame kept us at eye level. 
“You are have enjoyable time at Pinnacle Industries?”
“Yes, better now to have met you.”
“Yes, yes I will be like your mother here. Is this right to say?”
“We’ll see about that, let’s just be friends for now.”
“Yes, we are friends. We are friends. Did you have some chai?”
“We did. We are wondering about having our fixture welded…” I started.
“I see. Have you toured the factory? Have you only just arrived?” he asked.  
Siddarth held his hands fingers interlaced in front, and he wore slacks and a button-down shirt. In his late twenties, his black hair was thinning. Thin wrists held a small gold bracelet, fingers several rings. He wore wireframe glasses which he often adjusted. 
“Yes, we have arrived last night and have seen the factory. Mr. Millin brought us—“
“Mr. Millin is manager of welding for wheelchairs, I can take you to him.” he said, beginning to push us outside.
“No, No. Mr. Millin brought us here.” I said. 
Siddarth contemplated this, and asked the secretary something in Hindi. 
“Yes,” he said, “you are wanting to weld for the fixture, you need to make a repair.”
“No, we would like to make an entirely new fixture.” I said. 
He paused. “Yes. You are needing the tool room, yes?” he asked. 
“What is the tool room?”  
“This is the shop for making fixtures.” 

# The Tool Room

The Tool Room comprised an army of machine tools at attention against one wall of the metal building, and a PlexiGlass box containing a dozen CAD designers using pirated software to mill precision parts on an ancient 3-axis machine. There, Siddarth introduced us to Deepak, a short elfish man with a tattoo on his forearm that read DEEPAK in English letters in stylized Hindi script. 

We discussed a few parts that needed to be made for our new design. 

"This is not possible," Deepak said, looking at our drawings, "cannot be made."
"This is possible," I said, enumerating the difference operations needed, four in total. 
"We do not have machine for this."
I pointed to the machine twenty feet away, "that machine will do."
"No, sir, it is not possible because we need new tool."
"This is the Tool Room?"
"Yes sir, the tool room."
"Can you make a new tool?"
"Yes, sir, we make tools every day."
"Can we make a new tool?"
"Yes, we can make any tool," Deepak beamed.
"So here is the tool I need," I said, pointing again to my drawing.
"No sir, it is not possible. It cannot be made."

Deepak, unable to make his point cleat to me, called the CTO of the company to translate. After speaking in Hindi, his small tattooed arm waving wildly, he handed the phone to me. 

"Hello?"
"Yes, sir, the wheelchair man?"
"That's me."
"Yes, hello! This part cannot be made I am sorry."
"It can be made, I can make it with your machine, the machine is not in use."
"No, sir, I am sorry, sir but it cannot be made. We do not have the necessary ingredients. Why don't you use a different part," he said, suggesting an inferior design to save fractional material costs and time.
"No, sir, the chair will not work this way. I suggest we speak with Purchasing and order the materials that we need."
"Please let me speak to Deepak."

I handed the phone back to Deepak with a single head wag. He took the phone, returning the cranial oscillation. After a few minutes of Hindi, twisting the phone's cord with his finger, he set down the receiver. 

"Okay, sir, we are speaking with Purchasing and we are working to make everything highest quality as you prefer."
"Thank you Deepak." I would find out later that nothing was ordered. 

To move along with our prototype, we needed to machine a section of a wheelchair frame. Deepak and a small crowd followed me to a large milling machine. Sweat began to drip from my face to the concrete floor. Men working at lathes paused their work to watch my movements. 

"I need a hole here, and here, 8mm," pronouncing 'millimeters' as the workers did, 'em-em' to ease the translation. Deepak shouted orders at several men in the crowd around the machine. 
"You stand back, sir, this machine is very dangerous."

The machine was WWII-era cast-iron manual milling machine, currently fitted with a two-inch bit capable of drilling through a man with the flip of a small switch on the machines underbelly. The hole that these eight men were attempting to drill was much smaller, though it took all of them, together, fifteen minutes to change the bit and fixture the piece. Several of the fixtures were men's hands. I watched from a few feet away, and a stool appeared behind me. A turned to see a grinning elderly man drinking a cup of chai. He raised his glass to me and gestured to the stool. 

"Sit."

I sat and watched. The reach of the machine's bit was just short of driving through the part I needed, and several scraps of metal were used to move the workpiece closer to the spinning drill. No earplugs, gloves, safety goggles or OSHA. An hour after I entered the Tool Room, the bit moved through the workpiece. I stood, expecting the machine to turn off once it plunged entirely through my frame, but it kept moving slowly downwards. I tapped Deepak on his shoulder as the bit began to drill into the cast iron base of the milling machine. 

"That's enough it's gone through!" I yelled over the terrible drone of the machine. 

Deepak, without looking away from the machine's rape, waved his hand.

"No issue." 


# Lemontree and Kababsville

On Saturday, we packed our belongings for a trip into the nearest city, Indore, for a night in the Lemontree hotel. Siddarth planned a Sunday drive for us to see some ruins in "Mandu". Siddarth's friends from Pinnacle would join us for a dinner in Indore where they lived. 

Mahesh drove us into the city, dropped us at the hotel and disappeared. We reached the front desk and began the checkin process. I handed over my reservation receipt, my credit card, my passport and my visa which were each eyed by several young men on the opposite side of the desk. Sara was, as usual, completely ignored. Our escort, Mario, handed over his identification. 

"You are checking in with the ma'am?" The head clerk asked, eyeing my passport. 
"Yes, the ma'am and I will be in one room, and he has a single room." I pointed to Mario. He eyed Mario. 
"You are not wanting three rooms?"
"No, we are wanting just two rooms."
"Ma'am, may I please see your passport?" 
"I don't have it with me" Sara said. 
"Sara, you didn't bring your passport? Where is it?"
"I thought it would be safer to leave it at the factory."
"Okay, Mahesh can take her back to get it maybe?" I asked Mario.
"Mahesh is gone. Let's see. Sara, you're sure you don't have it?"
"Yeah, I left it and my visa."
"Okay. Sir, why is ma'am needing passport?" Mario asked. 
"I am needing passport to check into the room."
"We are checked into the room already, the room is not in ma'am's name. Is she still needing passport?"
"Yes, I am needing it."
"Okay, well, she does not have it. So can we have the room or no?"
"I am needing passport because two males and one female is needing a passport to check into room."
We let this logic sink it in silence. 
"I see, " Mario started, unsure of where he was going.
"Ma'am is staying in my room, and she will have passport soon. We will take our bags to the room, and have driver bring the passport here to us. You will see passport and it will be all good. Is that ok?" I asked. 
The three clerks conferred with one another about this plan in hushed Hindi. 
"This is going okay. You are bringing passport today?"
"Yes, the passport is coming to us but we are going to the room now and will be returning. This is ok?"
He wiggled his head, "Yes this is okay."
"Great, let's go guys."
"Who is bringing the passport?" Sara asked. 
"No one, just forget about it."

We walked up to our room and passed by framed posters of European artwork: Mirot and Cezanne mostly. Interspersed with the prints were framed joke t-shirts with quibs like "Why date an engineer? To find out what those other buttons on your calculator are for." I tried to reconcile this mix of apparel-based sophomoric humor with cheap abstract art posters while we dressed for dinner. 

The restaurant was called Kababsville. For 250 rupee (around $4.25) it's all you can eat. We ate with Siddarth and his friend, whose name was vocally indecipherable and would remain so throughout our trip. We ate a large feast of various flavorings of chicken and paneer mixed with rices and sauce. The conversation was kept to a minimal due to the loudness of the large, open restaurant and the amount of English available to Siddarth's companion. 

![][image-11]

"Do you like beer?" the friend asked me. His hair was parted in the middle, and his tall lanky shoulders hung over the table. 
"Yeah I do." I said. 
He giggled and bumped his shoulder against Siddarth's, who smiled shyly. 
"You want me to buy?"
"If you want some, sure?"
I hadn't formed the "sure" before he whistled and waved over one of the dozen waiters dressed in white shirts and black slacks with full black aprons. The waiter acknowledged his request and scurried away. A few seconds later two different waiters brought four large bottles of Kingfisher arrived. With an alcohol content of 3% for the "strong" type, I was interested to learn the drinking habits of the men. It seemed that each of us warranted a single bottle. We worked on our beers as more food came and went. 

"You like smoking?" The companion grinned.
"Occasionally."
"What is this?" He asked, intrigued. 
"Sometimes."
"Oh, oh some times you are taking smoke?"
"Sometimes."
"You are wanting smoke?"
"Right now?"
"Yes!"
"If you are wanting, I am wanting."
"I am wanting."
"Let's go."

Kabasville was part of a large hotel. A wedding was taking place over the high wall, the thump of the music reverberating into the restaurant's busy scene of scurrying waitstaff and bumbling buffet eaters. The hotel's swimming pool was down a short set of stairs from Kababsville. We walked next to the blue shimmering water and reached a group of smokers. 

"They are wanting to take smoke too like us," the friend gave his big grin, pulling a small pack of Wills Gold Flake from his pocket with a mini lighter. "How many you are wanting?"
"I'll just take one."
"A single?"
"A single."
He handed my a cigarette and lit it for me, then lit his own. He took a short puff and removed the white cylinder from his mouth to look at it, grinning. 
"It is good, yeah?"
"It's nice, thank you."
"Yes yes."

We smoked by the pool in silence. Every glance at the friend would reveal his shiny teeth. After dinner, Mahesh followed Siddarth's white Mahindra to Sarafa, a marketplace in the center of Indore. The sun set, and the smog became visible in the orange glow of street lamps as we stood outside a palace nestled between rows of urban shop spaces. We walked onto the skeleton of the palace's front garden past a tarp slung between two trees. Inside, a man slept on his back next to a large cow. 

"What is this building?" I asked Siddarth.
"This is old government building, for king of Indore."
"How old is it?"
"It is very old. Let us go to get jalebi."

![][image-12]

Jalebi is a bright orange sweet, deep fried wheat batter soaked in sugary syrup. A man sitting cross legged on a platform poured the batter from an old metal bowl in intricate patterns. The viscous strip bubbled at its edges. He caught us staring and laughed, pointing us out to the other vendors. Sarafa is a district full of sweets vendors. Crowded with people, looking upward you see miles of electrical wire strung between the buildings over the narrow streets. Motorbikes honked their horns, cows brayed, constant pushing through the mass of bodies. We moved through a large intersection onto a less dense street. 

![][image-13]
![][image-14]
![][image-15]

"We go to see Garam. He will make us paan."

Wind blew across the wide street, bits of paper and plastic rustled into the air. Dust stirred. Men slept atop their pushcarts, protecting them overnight. Cows lay in groups of three, there tails flicking flies from their backs. We turned right and saw a single shop surrounded by people. A large green awning held white letters: GARAM TEASELLER.

![][image-16]
![][image-17]
![][image-18]

"Is paan a type of tea?"
"No, no, Garam is not a teaseller, only the maker of paan, he is the paanwala. Best paanwala in Indore" Siddarth answered.
"Best paanwala in India!" His friend said, flashing his big smile back at us. 

Garam sat crosslegged on a table the heigh of his counter. His large toenails were black and his hands were kept busy grabbing large green betel leaves with his right and adding areca, perching the leaf on arches of his feet. He added mint and other herbs, finishing the treat by rolling the leaf, sealing it, and muttering a prayer in Hindi as he reached forward, placing the paan into the open mouth of the current customer. Garam's few teeth were stained red from the areca nut, and he smiled and wagged his head when he saw us approaching. 

"He wants you to try his work."
"What is is?"
"It is after dinner, a dessert you eat for good digestion."

Garam wiggled his big toes. 

"I think I am too full for paan."
"No, it is necessary. You must not offend Mr. Garam."

As Garam held out the treat for my mouth, I reached for a handoff. He jerked the paan back and looked at me, confused, and then to Siddarth who spoked quickly in their language, using his hands for emphasis towards my ignorance.

"Mr. Garam asks that you let him bless you."
"He wants to put it into my mouth?"

![][image-19]

Men began to gather around the shop, looking from me to Garam to Siddarth and back at me as if they anticipated a brawl. I imagined their chattering as forming the terms of a wager. I wondered what the odds were that I would leave without paan in my mouth. 

"He would like to offer you the paan. It is good for digestion" Siddarth held an apologetic expression and rubbed circles on his stomach. 

I leaned forward, looking across the counter into the yellow eyes of Mr. Garam and opened my mouth. The cold, damp leaves touched my tongue and the long nail of his messy finger brushed against my upper lift as the delicacy was delivered. The first bite through the leaves was an shower of flavor. Red juice ran down my chin and the inside of my cheeks tingled with mint. The leaf crunched and the neatly wrapped package became a large mush. I tipped my head back in order to speak. 

"It's good" I gargled. 

The betting men laughed and showed me how to spit. I left a large puddle of red on the sidewalk next to the counter. Hands squeezed my shoulder. I turned to see Mr. Mahesh leaning against the far wall of the shop, his baseball hat casting shadows on his face under the streetlamp. Arms crossed, he smiled. I returned a grin with red teeth. 

The next day, we went to Mandu.
