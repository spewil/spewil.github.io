# byron's experimentation (a primer)

This is a first pass at an abstract, off the cuff, to submit to the 2018 International Byron Society Conference in Ravenna, Italy. 

experimentation, hypothesis-- guess-and-check, exploration

what do we know about the man and his work that suggests he practiced some sort of scientific method? can we extract some sort of method from the formal particulars of his pieces?

imagination as exploration, as experiment? 

Rousseau’s ideas were precursors to the Age of Sensibility and Romanticism, whereby subjectivity, feeling and introspection took centre stage in a man’s life.

*"Imagination has traditionally been seen as a major topic in the study of
mental life, a concept at the level of consciousness or volition, not as a
subordinate and ancillary function to be selectively drawn on in planning
and decision making."*

there is an untouched set of dichtomies: past and future (past, present, future) and fact and fiction. Scientists generally assume that Past is Fact, that is, objective happenings, while Future is Fiction, that which will be is imagined. But there is a conflation of perspective; Fiction is inherently Subjective, while Fact is inherently Objective. Reconciling these four concepts is crucial before thinking deeply about memory and imagination. 

Is it not that the Romantics turned us onto a way of thinking about ourselves as imaginative, willful agents? That is, what I can imagine is what I can create? This set us back because of an extreme: I, as I exists, am all-powerful 

Romantics break the tradition of associationism to give power to the mind's imagination outright; the imagination, Romantics write, has a generative power all its own. 

vital vs mechanical -- invention vs inscription, transcription vs production -- is Rilke inventing when the lightning strikes? What is this act of poesy? 

projection, transport, empathy 

Janus hypothesis: past and future (memory and imagination) are instrinsically linked by their neurobiological substrate (possibly the hippocampus as the site of episodic memory?)

creative vs. re-creative (productive vs reproductive)

>Keats and Byron: The Distinction Between Imaginative and Intellectual Romantic Ideals [link](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~dwhite/222/old/214.htm)

>Keats, for instance, chooses the power of the imagination to escape by identifying himself with an external entity. Byron, on the other hand, as demonstrated by the character of Manfred, opts to harness his own intellect by refusing to concede to any power that does not originate from his own mental experience. 
>Byron finds no sanctuary in anything other than his own intellect.

Byron, or Manfred...? 

Childe Harold iv.134-137:

From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy	
Have I not seen what human things could do?	        
From the loud roar of foaming calumny	
To the small whisper of the as paltry few,	
And subtler venom of the reptile crew,	
The Janus glance of whose significant eye,	
Learning to lie with silence, would seem true,	        
And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,	
Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.

>Manfred, the protagonist, has many encounters with the supernatural world and society. At these times, he denies the assistance of all and finds no other alternative than to rely solely on his own intellect or consciousness. Byron fails to opt for good or evil and simply chooses neither by refusing to acknowledge the validity of anything outside his consciousness.

Defaulting to Fiction: Neuroscience Rediscovers the Romantic Imagination (Alan Richardson)
	>Daniel Gilbert (2006) : “ability to imagine episodes and objects that do not exist in the realm of the real” is the single “greatest achievement of the human brain.” 
	
	>Romanticism, the period, according to Daston (1998), when imagination gained an “almost mystical” sense of creative originality, “independent or even in defiance of reason and will.” 
	
	>"There is no Imagination" Liu (1989)
	
	>this human imaginative capacity seems strangely attenuated—one might even say tamed—in the accounts of many cognitive scientists, some of whom deliberately seek to render the imagination rule bound and quotidian
	
	>Ignoring centuries of literary scholarship on imagination, in other words, has made for an impoverished scientific agenda.
	
	>The human mind’s propensity to project itself into other times, places, perspectives, and even invented worlds—which may turn out to be its “default” tendency (Buckner et al. 2008)—can best be understood through interdisciplinary dialogue among cognitive researchers and literary scholars.
	
	>Pretend play suggests that the human “disposition toward fiction” is “remarkably deep-rooted,” emerging in the second year of life, significantly “at about the same time as speech itself.” Harris (2000)
	
	>It might seem odd that memory researchers would have become involved in studies of imagination in the first place, since we ordinarily think of memory as concerned with the factual—matters of autobiographical and historical record—and not with the merely possible, let alone the impossible. Imagination, in contrast, frequently concerns the nonfactual and even the counterfactual. It functions to model or simulate possible future events that, however likely, might never come to pass, to create fictional scenarios that are not expected to correspond point by point with the lived world, and to propose and delineate entities and events that could not possibly exist, such as flying horses or out-of-body travel. Despite this seeming opposition, however, recent work in cognitive neuroscience suggests that remembering the past and imagining the future may in fact be closely related functions of a single cognitive system or at least kindred functions that overlap significantly and share many of the same neural mechanisms. This has been termed the “Janus hypothesis,” namely, that retrospection into the past and prospection into the future are “closely linked in mind and brain” (Dudai and Carruthers 2005).
	
	>In the area of neuropathology, amnesiac patients suffering from damage to the hippocampus (widely seen as central to forming episodic memories) were found to exhibit a greatly diminished capacity to construct “imaginary” future scenarios (Hassabis et al. 2007).
	
	>As Schacter (2007) explains, episodic memory is “reconstructive” rather than “reproductive”: it involves a “constructive process of putting together bits and pieces of information” rather than storing “exact replicas of past experience,” such as a video camera or other mechanical recording device might provide. 
	
	> If its function were solely to recapture the personal past as reliably as possible, episodic memory would look flawed, to say the least. But if memory serves equally to help one imagine possible futures, the seeming design flaws of episodic memory might instead prove to be adaptive advantages. 
	
	> “primary role of mental time travel into the past is to provide raw material from which to construct and imagine possible futures” Thomas Suddendorf and Michael C. Corballis (2007)
	
	>Any act of “thinking” that involves objects of cognition not immediately present to the senses (including reverie or daydreaming) is, for Locke (ibid.: 226–27), a matter of remembrance. For both Hobbes and Locke, then, the conjunction, if not identity, of memory and imagination is fundamental: there could be no prospection into the future or connected “mental discourse” at all in the absence of memory.
	
	>Coleridge (1983): fancy is the cut and pasting of past memories while the secondary imagination “dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create”. The “primary imagination is the agency of perceiving and learning”: Coleridge understands perception itself as a creative activity, involving the interplay of external impressions with various powers of mind rather than a mechanical enregistration of sense data on a passive, “blank slate”–style mental apparatus. 
	
	>It would seem that the secondary imagination, no less than the fancy, must rely for its materials on memory only in a remarkably different way from the fancy, dynamic rather than passive, “vital” (as Coleridge puts it) rather than mechanical.
	
	> No one is likely to propose searching for a neural substrate for Coleridge’s secondary imagination, but if anyone were, the hippocampus would certainly be the place to start. 
	
	>First, however, it is worth noticing how the “Janus hypothesis” can enhance and reframe our appreciation for the surprisingly prospective or future-oriented character of Romantic literary treatments of memory. 
	
	>Wordsworth: What the poet imagines, looking toward the future, is a life filled with memories.
	
	>Coleridge: Here memory and imagination fuse creatively to produce an alternative future for the son modeled on the father’s past while inverting it and at the same time incorporating the tone and ethos of Wordsworth’s remembered childhood in “Tintern Abbey” and similar poems.
	
	>Austen: Emma exemplifies the potential pitfalls involved in “remembering the past to imagine a future” (Schacter et al. 2007), showing how the distorted memories of an “imaginist” can help give rise to highly unrealistic future scenarios (here especially in relation to matchmaking) that encourage maladroit social behavior and jeapordize legitimate opportunities for future happiness. 
	
	>“So when a man compoundeth the image of his own person with the image of the actions of another man, as when a man imagines himself a Hercules or an Alexander, which happeneth often to them that are much taken with reading of romances, it is a compounded imagination, and properly but a fiction of the mind.”
	
	>Melanie C. Green and her colleagues report that “individuals regularly alter their real-world beliefs and attitudes in response to fictional communications”
	
	>Scott's Waverly: Personal and collective memories, obsessively rehearsed and nurtured over generations, range these characters against the inevitable progress of modernity, which can be creatively modified but not airily wished away.
	
	>Mental time travel and mind reading both belong to a newly discriminated system of cognitive activities, all associated with the same network of brain areas, one that has been christened the brain’s “default network” (this is not universally accepted, and may be an effect of vascularity patterns). Neuroscientists thus stumbled on what Buddhist meditators had already known for millennia: that “most human beings spend fifty to ninety percent or more of their time in their imagination, living in fantasy” Beck (1995). The difference is that Buckner and his colleagues view all of this “spontaneous cognition” as “healthy and adaptive." In the Buddhist tradition, it is instead what makes us miserable, drawing us away from the present moment and poisoning our lives.
	
	>Samuel Johnson (1968) notes that the mind’s habitual condition is one of “incessant cogitation”—the default state. Given a “power so restless” as this bias toward spontaneous cognition, keeping “reason the constant guard over imagination” becomes a crucial precondition to living a moral life. An unchecked imagination will eventually lead to a pernicious “disease of the soul”.
	
	>Here cognitive scientists and neuroscientists would do well to extend their collaborative, interdisciplinary ethos to embrace the work of colleagues they have not as yet taken much into account: scholars, critics, and theorists of literature. 

the poet, modeling his work after byron, tries to find creativity— he travels, with no success (fails at the camino, etc) 

he tries to read papers about neuroscience of philosophy — his friend (danbee-esque) hooks him up to a machine to stimulate his brain. I began to search intensely for some scientific understanding of creativity and imagination. What is this concept? 

paper about byron + story about paper’s conception 

it’s about looking in front of you rather than within it, the world. I had to learn to be in my body in the world, rather than a self-adjuster, perturber of artifacts. 

byron’s self-aggrandizement, about total worship of self, self-image, rather than john donne’s island metaphor 

I couldn’t go on, there was nothing left. I felt like a summarizer, an algorithmic turner into of proliferated thoughts into kernels of truism. There were no branching paths, but convergence to single, isolated points. Islands left after rising waters of uncertainty and lack of restraint.
