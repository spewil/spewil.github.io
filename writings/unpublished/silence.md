# silence and pause 

I use my headphones every day. If I'm not running my mouth on the phone with friends or family, I'm listening to podcasts of which there are years of quality content. I'm not much of an audiobook listener, the reasons for which I have yet to unlock. 

My headphones broke. Because I'm one of the world's finest cheapskates, I went about a week trying to bum headphones off of others and lifting every couch cushion in search of lost buds. No luck. 

While buying Christmas presents, I splurged on a new pair of earbuds (Â£20). Back in the podcast game again. Sitting on the tube heading home from work, however, I made a point not to put them in. This is rare. Whenever I'm sitting, I'm either writing, reading, or doodling. If I can't do those things, I'm listening to something. 

Sitting on the train then, I realized suddenly (and stupidly) the incredible power of silence. Curation and culling of inputs doesn't mean there shouldn't room for silence and pause. Perhaps part of curation is lapses, sections of absence, holes in the stream of input. Is this meditation, or something else?

Try letting your mind wander. I'm always surprised. With seemingly no input, I'm continually surprised at what crops up. How does this work? How can a mind unfocused produce what seems to be novel connections between representations? 

When curating your personal input selections, leave some elbow room.
