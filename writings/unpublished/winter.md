the first time I read *The Great Gatsby* was two years ago. it was one of those highschool books I happened to skip in favor of Faulkner, which, at the time, I thought was a good decision. now I realize I wasn't clever enough then to appreciate Faulkner. I was clever enough to understand the highest abstracted form of *Gatsby*, and I think I would have found something in him that I found instead in Robert Jordan in the cave in Spain. I read *Gatsby* aloud while I was at home, before I moved to England. 

A professor in college told me about his theory of spirals being the topology of many natural dynamical systems, but his only supporting evidence thus far, his case study, was through his teaching. "I don't understand this," I told him. "You don't have to. If you did, I wouldn't be teaching you. This works in a spiral, and it works well. I show it to you now, you don't get it, I do my best, and we have this conversation and move on. You retain a nagging frustration at the concept and a year from now, maybe two, this will show up again, and you'll get it. In that moment, you'll have made a full rotation around the circle, but forward in time. A spiral."

I feel like I'm constantly rotating, but the circle is, I hope, getting bigger. I've started to wonder if it, in fact, gets smaller. how much can it hold, anyway, if I keep coming back around? I'm about to start *Gatsby* again, two years later, and I'm most excited for what will happen this time. When I was a kid, my dad gave me *Jonathan Livingston Seagull* with the advice "every time you read it, it will be different, that's how it works."

I've been thinking about curation recently, and I think there is currently or will be a rise in curation. Some of the most widely-used website perform such a function collaboratively, and I think it would be interesting to think about how to make these tools work better. How do we best discover new information ourselves? I am a big fan of Goodreads (although I would like to spearhead a complete redesign of their UI...), but I only use it as a logging service. Finding new books requires cross-referencing, conversation, wiki pages, and reading criticism. This is some sort of graph traversal problem, and I'm sure a simple random walker could pretty well predict my trajectories. however, in my search there seems to be a sort of top-down mission. self-discovery, mind-expansion, whatever you want to call it. it's this mission that defines what I deem worthy of my time to take in and ponder. 

curators seem like hubs and like filters. information pours into them and a selection pours out. of course, information is not destroyed during the filtering process, but it is tempered, it is weighted. how do we come to trust this process, and how much of the curation is a nonlinear measure of our respect for the work? I think of Jack Spicer, both in his relative obscurity and his relative fame through curation. for a while I thought that I could never do a graduate degree in humanities because it would be a process of finding/searching/discovering some inane documents and arguing their importance. is this another form of curation? 

I didn't do a humanities degree for this reason, in fact. is that wrong? what does it mean? I think of the canonical record-shop guy, or anyone with a niche. intellectual niches functioning in an evolutionary cultural system? what does competition look like, and what are the forces of culture? heidegger's little black books and lee morgan's gun? curation seems to be important, and I would like to work towards a useful definition and philosophy of it.
