born in estonia, family's aristocratic wealth was expropriated by the russians

Uexküll argued that organisms perceived the experience of living in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world' subjective reference frames that he called Umwelt (translated as milieu, situation, embedding-lit. German for environment)

he's pre-Heidegger, and paved the way for Heidegger's Dasein 

The umwelt is composed of two parts, the innenwelt or self-oriented features, and the Umgebung, or world-oriented features. Together, they describe the individual's subjective viewpoint, or embedding, which has the property of being ubiquitous, as compared to the observer's objective viewpoint, which has the property of being universal. 

how does this relate to spinoza?

his theory of life: 
the characteristics of biological existence ("life") could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.

this could be taken for a sort of pan-psychism that's popular today 

Josef Pieper argued that reason allows the human person to live in "Welt" (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas.

semeion meaning "sign"

Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication. It is not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called semiology which is a subset of semiotics. This includes the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication.

we need, in our time, a “modification of the concept of Uexküllian Umwelt [which] respects the deepest spirit of the author.”
