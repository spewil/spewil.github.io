# idea dichotomy 

think about the transcription process— how does this happen for me? Maybe I can help people get into that state, that context, that pattern. 

lawrence has trouble feeling the lightning strike of inspiration, but is well-practiced at honing creative focus, of expanding ideas from stubs, generating ideas that aren't pre meditated... i'm looking for "intra-meditated" inspirations, meditations in the moment 

why does inspiration have to "strike"? 

what research exists on creativity? --

question everything-- why was i intrigued by sub2 nike project? 

Rilke on Duino, Ruth Stone's earth-shaking, vibrational transcription 

self-evaluation as creativity? 

Dennett: 
>So the apparent conflict (expressed by Rilke) between the ideal of spontaneity and the ideal of rational deliberation is an illusion. While no one of sound mind would choose a totally chaotic policy of decision and deliberation, it is equally true that the purest devotee of reason will be led, by that very devotion, to a policy that includes a fair measure of “letting yourself go.”

prediction / expectation maximization, common sense, minimize unexpectedness, cost of creativity 

four dimensional space-time worm. if we have any belief in darwinian evolution, then how could we not have a belief in determinism? 

"slowly by slowly" -- Kenyan saying 

system description 
local v gloval ==> micro v macro ==> overlaps=accidents ==> webs of causality 

determinism is a humanism, or invokes one, because to believe in a deterministic universe, you have to truly comprehend, or try, the unbelievable nature of humanity and its collective creations-- culture, writing, creativity. determinism is a faith in a scientific construction, but it is empirical. so by occam's razor it should, rationally, be the version of reality in which we believe. but this deduction doesnt leave us facing ourselves in a mirror that exposes our stupid, mechanistic selves. those selves being born from an astronomical number of interactions, we are each unique constellations of our cells, systems of systems of fantastically complex particles. The emergence of ourselves is as beautiful as the emergence of the universe itself, as we are each universes entire.  

"Aha" moments vs. continuous discovery
