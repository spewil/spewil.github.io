# moral control, ethical feedback 

there is a control theoretic perspective of moral manufacture that i haven't seen before

how do the linguistic tools of control theory give rise to an understanding of meaning manufacture? 

semiotics is signal processing and information transcription 

if morals are intimately tied to commendments from on high, of forbiddeness (deleuze uses the Genesis myth to support his reading of Spinoza's ethics not as a moral code but as a practical prescription for ethical life), then they must be tied to a control theory. Dennett the first to take control theory seriously in the context of free will, though Wiener and the other cyberneticians back to Uexk√ºll understood that the feedback process (functional cycles) in biology would give rise to some sort of ethics, an auto-generation of dichotomous descriptions: this is good because it is good for me, this is bad because it is bad for me. This first subjective step then, I conjecture, moved into the social setting by being further removed from the individual: this is good/bad for me because it is good/bad for my progeny or my ability to procreate. This might be base, but it's a start. 

where control theory hasn't been implicated, I believe, is in the generation of morals. These occur when this direct empirical act hasn't occurred. When the reach of the logical steps between oneself and the positive/good or negative/bad feedback signal becomes "too great" (whatever that means), does this become Good and Evil? 

think back on the story of the boots and the Finnish Army: deviant behavior would happen because the empirical step was lost. The CO says to do something and , well, this is a control signal but not one that is subjective feedback. It's a controller external imposing its values onto you. "Tie your boots," CO says, "that's an order". The CO is telling you what is Good (tied boots) and Evil (untied boots). What the CO has personally seen is a man die in the mud because of tripping over his laces many years ago. This has now evolved into a commandement from God. 

In this way, the separation between subjective feedback loops (what we might call local Truth, Umwelt, I'm not sure yet) and external control signals is the dichotomy of dichotomies-- good/bad and Good/Evil. 

how is this not just restating what deleuze has expertly laid out using Spinoza and Nietzsche as proxies? the addition here is the highlighting of the finitude of the human mind, and the function of memory. if we are sensory processing machines that distill empirical results-- i put my hand in the fire and it gets burned= i dont put my hand on things that have been near the fire or firelike things for risk of getting burned. that's the logic/reasoning. in my mind, fire=bad in some contexts and good in others (e.g. i'm freezing to death). 

i have a goal: to live forever. that is my control goal. how does this difference between feedback and external signal work with this overarching control goal? my personal project depends on feedback signals, for these are how i live and learn and generate infinitude through finitude. external signals, if appropriate in my context, are welcomed. in others they may not be. 

aristocratic morals are ethics, as their inifinitude is certain from the onset. they exist in a structure that is made for longevity-- their blood. their bodies will continue. commoners try to keep this custom through religious means in a universal sense, but locally with the production of families. 

in the current time, the Beyond Good and Evil-time, because we are not able to generate or retain all of our local empirical results, we reach blindly for external guidance/signals. tribes form

how does the internet allow us to retain more data, lessen our mypoia? (detective link here, the clue is always in front of Dupin's nose (e.g. purloined letter)). i think not-- i think the forms in which our finitude are manifested are the the only infinites. this seems simple: "the only rule is that there are no rules", "the only infiniteness is our finiteness."

but is control just reduces to such a rule-based system? conditionals? "if this, then Evil", "if that, then Good"? perhaps signal processing/control is a continuous rule-based. f(this) = that, where an infinite number of this and thats exist, but the function must be bijective (unique ins and outs). 

'Experience' is then a catalog of rules? seems too simple. the rules are embedded in our brains, they're physical. but how can someone tell you something once and it sticks? if they are credible? is this a microscopic change? how does one near-instantly have a "change of heart"? is this a self-controlled process slightly altered?

if you defy your father, this is ultimately of little utility, you learn quickly. from there is not a changing of labels? who the father is? seems very psychoanalytic, not control theoretic. but i dont want to back into the theory.

Kant wiki: "The capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called pure practical reason, which is contrasted with pure reason (the capacity to know without having been shown) and mere practical reason (which allows us to interact with the world in experience). Hypothetical imperatives tell us which means best achieve our ends."

humans are self-controllers with the goal of living forever. then produce loops of meaning based on: experience (practical reason) and abstraction (imagined feedback, metaphor, semiotics, sign-interplay). the abstraction is the reduction to the finite storage power that we have, the "lumping" of ideas/signs/feedbacks into a number of interacting components. 

good regulator/internal model control minimizes entropy, but it can be different from classical feedback control methods. this difference could be the analog for pure practical reason and practical reason.
