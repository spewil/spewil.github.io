# cybernetics 

shift from epistemology to ontology -- from what we know to what we are, ways of being 

acting is a radical artistic pursuit because it highlights the fluidity of our persons. if someone is a bad actor it is because they have not realized or fully understood the fluidity of character-- of emotion and context and memory.

a pluripotence of being doesn't entail connecting emotionally with a rock, but it does open an ontological multitude not just for other life forms, but for each of us ourselves. 

if we are the result of an uncountable number of interactions, a reduction to these interactions to produce an emergent self, then these selves are themselves interations, they are the focal point of a number of interactions. 

cybernetics embodies this rationale

especially with second-order cybernetics - watching the watchers watch the system 

the material, hylephobic metaphors (erosion, crystallization) at once with the titular sculpture metaphor 

dennett:

> In my student days I thought I was going to be a sculptor, and I addressed myself more energetically to blocks of wood and stone than to either philosophy or science. It occurred to me while working on this book that I have never abandoned the methods I developed in the studio, but simply changed media. Unlike the draftsman, who must get each line just right with the first stroke of the pen, the sculptor has the luxury of nibbling and grinding away until the lines and surfaces look just right. First you rough out the block, standing back and squinting now and then to make sure you are closing in on the dimly seen final product. Only after the piece is bulked out in the right proportions do you return to each crude, rough surface and invest great labor in getting the fine details just so. 

> This vision of self-formation represents the gradual development of self to be importantly unlike other processes of material transformation that might seem to be appropriate metaphors to those hylephobes with lazy imaginations: crystal formation, erosion, ripening, the formation of scar tissue. Self-formation, unlike these, is informationally sensitive, amenable to indefinitely many levels of meta-level criticism, and “creative” in a way that art is: the forms that emerge contribute to the constitution of the can- ons by which they are judged. 

> The very decision to write a book—a traditional book like this, composed of sentences and not, say, a bound collection of pages smeared with various jams and jellies—may seem to beg the question in favor of free will. If so, then those who have written books and articles denying the reality of free will are in an even more embarrassing position: they are left advising (pretending to advise? seeming to advise?) the reader that advising is pointless.
