# detectives 

the detective story is the modern mono-myth because after we realized that science can predict much more than listening out for signs from god, we all embarked on a quest not for meaning handed to us from on high, but from the empirical existences we all lead. clues take the place of signs in this kind of world. the key to the detective story is that people lie. people betray-- that reminds us of apples and trees in two sense: adam and isaac. 

is it funny that isaac newton's name is the signifier for the test of abraham. we should sacrifice this man for his faith in God, but no-- we stop him and sacrifice a ram instead. rams are known for battling, for butting heads.

never stop writing. graham greene, though i have read none of his novels, apparently wrote five novels before he found a publisher. writing and writing is the only way. vomit drafts, first drafts, any drafts. 

be a detective, find clues and put together a narrative. make writing a search for solutions to cases that arise along the way. 

detectives = signs, clues 

error theory, nihilism, and anti-natalism

nihilism isn't fatalism 

local fatalism is tolerable 

meaning, sign generation 

detectives and writers drink a lot
