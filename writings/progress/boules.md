# The Boules Game 



-- This has never happened before, 

one of the old men said. They were standing in a circle, the five of them, looking down on the small pink ball, what they called the _connochet_, the piglet, and two larger, metal spheres-the boules. Each of them could see themselves and the men standing next to them in each of silver boules.

-- What happens now?
-- I don't know, 

asked the smallest man. He had a thick crop of orange hair, and he was the only one wearing shorts so that you could see his thin, pale legs. His face held a disgusted expression at nothing in particular. It was a cool, sunny afternoon in the _place de petanqeurs_, but he would occasionally look up to the few clouds overhead and grimace. After an hour of play, his face darkened to a deep red. 

-- Let's just measure it again, 

said the oldest man. His wife sat on the low wall that ran along the sides of the _place_. She walked him to the court and entertained their small terrier, which, during exciting tosses of the shiny spheres, would bark in anticipation of the next lie, hoping to join in on the throwing of round objects. 

-- We've measured three times already. 
-- Let my wife measure it?  
-- She doesn't even play! 
-- For the better, she will be unbiased. 
-- Sure, ask her over. 

She old man shuffled to the wall and took a seat next to his wife. The other men watched as he pointed and mumbled the situation at hand. The man with the orange hair kicked the dirt and spit. 

-- Ridiculous, just ridiculous. 
-- Calm down, she'll choose one of them. 
-- I can plainly see which one is closer!
-- Tell me then, which?
-- That one there! Clearly!
-- A moment ago you said it was the other one,

said the quietest man in the group, who happened to be the best player, and the one who threw the shot that landed the group in this position. No one blamed him of course, that was the game, but they listened when he spoke. 

-- and now you've said this one. 
-- It's always been this one. It's been his,

the red-faced man pointed to the man with the thick glasses. 

-- Oh, he wouldn't be able to see it if he tried! 

They all laughed as the man with the thick spectacles looked to the others for support. The old woman joined the circle, her husband watching the dog along the wall. 

-- What seems to be the problem? 

She held her hands behind her back, as the men did, and held an inquisitive look like that of a detective standing over a corpse. 

-- We need to figure out which of these is further from the piggy. 
-- Well that can't be too hard, now can it? 
-- Let's see then. 

The woman carried a large handbag, dusty and worn. She rummaged inside and brought out a piece of thread. She pulled the thread taught, holding it between her thumb and forefinger of each hand. Bending slowly, she placed her left hand atop the piglet in such a way as to point the thread in the direction of one of the boules. Pulling the thread through her fingers, she stopped her right thumb and forefinger at the center of the silver sphere, her nose enlarged in the convex mirror. With a quick flick of her arm, the thread snapped precisely where her fingers had held it over the boule. Without moving the fingers of her left hand on the thread, she shuffled around such that the thread hung in line with the second boule. Pulling the thread taught with her right hand, the newly severed end of the thread stopped just over the center of the second boule. The woman exhaled through her nose sharply and measured again. The thread stopped just over the center of the second boule. 

The men hissed and muttered to themselves. The old woman stood up slowly and tucked the two pieces of thread back into her handbag. 

-- Why don't you flip a coin? 

The men stopped and turned back toward the woman. 

-- A coin? That's not the game.
-- The game needs a winner, no? Let the coin decide.
-- Madame, these are not the rules.
