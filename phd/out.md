What is this?
=============

This is an experiment in creating an open kind of thesis. We'll work
together using [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/) to annotate this
living document, for which we'll track changes using
[git](www.github.com/spewil). In less than two years, this page will
represent the culminated collective effort of a few people to better
understand the organizing principles of human motor learning.

What am I Doing?
================

I'm working on my PhD at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural
Circuits and Behavior. I'm setting up an experiment that will take
organizing principles of movement, of sensorimotor control and learning
