It helps to point to strong examples, and we have one in the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a biomedical and genomic research center. In 2016, agile enthusiasts at the Broad Institute launched an open agile community of practice called “Agile Academia” in order to learn more about the practices and how they might be applied to help non-software teams. The group now includes representatives from more than 20 of Broad’s laboratory and administrative departments and meets monthly to discuss agile practices and coordinate in-depth agile training and agile meetup events for the Broad Institute community. As a result, agile values, routines, and tools have naturally spread into teams through the organization as more people learned about their benefits
