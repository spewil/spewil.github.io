Where is my name?

I could be anywhere. 
<br>
<br>
You march on your fingertips
                                  step on concrete cracks. 
<br>
With hands you hold your head 
                             think between fingertips. 
<br>
We search and we sort for we and 
                                                                 we turn to the spirit we ask 
                                                                                                                          May I borrow this book? 
                  No 
                they say 
                                  and you find your hands 
                                                                                  stuck to the desk 
                                                                                       with webs.  
They search and they sort and 
                                                         they use their will 
                                                                                                 to consume shellfish. 
The cracks widen. 
<br>

You reconnect in a subaqueous suburb 
						where your neighbor mows his front porch. 

You ask if drowning men need drink 
He shrugs.
<br>

You pay good money
 	removing another organ of truth  

under local anesthesia 
       			provided by the local radio station. 

<br>

Due to the effects of buoyancy 
you dance and dance until 

carrier pigeons from rooftops remind you 	
of your fines. 

You return to the surface. 
<br>


Standing by the pool 
                           		briefly 
                                  	  I appears. 
He is someone else. 
     His dance is fluid. 
<br>

His dance is 
     better 
than you. 
He mumbles:
<br>

Twist me and turn me and show me your wealth.

Look in the water-- discover yourself.
