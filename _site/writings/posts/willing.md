I seem to have a very difficult time waking up in the morning at the time I've decided on the night before. Reading Daniel Dennett's *Elbow Room*, I've realized (again) that I've been profoundly affected by my understanding and acceptance, over the last few years, of a hard determinism. I've written about how we can come to reconcile this reduction with a generation of new forms and lines of thought elsewhere, but I'm reflecting now on the personal form of a discovery and subsequent acceptance. 

Walking to the London Byron Society Christmas lunch, I listened to a [podcast](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-274-mara-shalhoup) with Mara Shalhoup about alt weekly newspapers and their importance for the communities in which they are distributed. Naturally, I Googled "London Atl Weekly" with hopes of emailing someone about contributing. I found [a newspaper](https://www.oye.news/) dedicated to conspiracy theories named Open Your Eyes News along with a lot of event listing sites. It seems there isn't an alternative weekly in London. Naturally, I began to draft a Facebook message to my friend Sam. 

> dude. we need to start a newspaper. we can edit it, and find some advertising funding for things we like in london. it won't make any money, but that's not the point. we could print it ourselves like a chapbook. poetry, prose, random articles, maybe some sleuthing. like a lit mag but cooler and physical. like a zine but more like a newspaper. let me know what you think. it could be really cool. monthly or weekly?  

I arrived at the East India Club which, among an obvious colored history, lays claim to the site where the battle of Waterloo was announced to the Prince Regent. Byron would not have approved of the lunch venue, surely. At any rate, the company was all friendly and mostly elderly, my favorite kind of dining club lunch company. The main even of the lunch was a reading of two poems and a letter from Byron to Thomas Moore, his dearest friend, which I have copied below in full, with the Moore's reply. 

What's more interesting, the synchronicity or the difference in the recurrence? What aspect of the difference? Language is fluid, the medium has evolved, yes, but what's more? Not much, I would say. Nietzsche wins again.

Ravenna, Dec. 25. 1820.

You will or ought to have received the packet and letters which I remitted to your address a fortnight ago (or it may be more days), and I shall be glad of an answer, as, in these times and places, packets per post are in some risk of not reaching their destination.

I have been thinking of a project for you and me, in case we both get to London again, which (if a Neapolitan war don't suscitate) may be calculated as possible for one of us about the spring of 1821. I presume that you, too, will be back by that time, or never; but on that you will give me some index. The project, then, is for you and me to set up jointly a newspaper—nothing more nor less—weekly, or so, with some improvement or modifications upon the plan of the present scoundrels, who degrade that department,—but a newspaper, which we will edite in due form, and, nevertheless, with some attention.

There must always be in it a piece of poesy from one or other of us two, leaving room, however, for such dilettanti rhymers as may be deemed worthy of appearing in the same column; but this must be a sine quâ non; and also as much prose as we can compass. We will take an office—our names not announced, but suspected—and, by the blessing of Providence, give the age some new lights upon policy, poesy, biography, criticism, morality, theology, and all other ism, ality, and ology whatsoever.

Why, man, if we were to take to this in good earnest, your debts would be paid off in a twelvemonth, and by dint of a little diligence and practice, I doubt not that we could distance the common- place blackguards, who have so long disgraced common sense and the common reader. They have no merit but practice and impudence, both of which we may acquire; and, as for talent and culture, the devil's in't if such proofs as we have given of both can't furnish out something better than the 'funeral baked meats' which have coldly set forth the breakfast table of all Great Britain for so many years. Now, what think you? Let me know; and recollect that, if we take to such an enterprise, we must do so in good earnest. Here is a hint,—do you make it a plan. We will modify it into as literary and classical a concern as you please, only let us put out our powers upon it, and it will most likely succeed. But you must live in London, and I also, to bring it to bear, and we must keep it a secret.

As for the living in London, I would make that not difficult to you (if you would allow me), until we could see whether one means or other (the success of the plan, for instance) would not make it quite easy for you, as well as your family; and, in any case, we should have some fun, composing, correcting, supposing, inspecting, and supping together over our lucubrations. If you think this worth a thought, let me know, and I will begin to lay in a small literary capital of composition for the occasion.

Yours ever affectionately,

B.

P.S. If you thought of a middle plan between a *Spectator* and a newspaper, why not?—only not on a Sunday. Not that Sunday is not an excellent day, but it is engaged already. We will call it the 'Tenda Rossa,' the name Tassoni gave an answer of his in a controversy, in allusion to the delicate hint of Timour the Lame, to his enemies, by a 'Tenda' of that colour, before he gave battle. Or we will call it 'Gli,' or 'I Carbonari,' if it so please you—or any other name full of 'pastime and prodigality,' which you may prefer. Let me have an answer. I conclude poetically, with the bellman, 'A merry Christmas to you!'


*Reply From Sir Thomas Moore:*


The following passage from the letter of mine, to which the above was an answer, will best explain what follows:—With respect to the newspaper, it is odd enough that Lord ??? and myself had been (about a week or two before I received your letter) speculating upon your assistance in a plan somewhat similar, but more literary and less regularly-periodical in its appearance. Lord ??? as you will see by his volume of Essays, if it reaches you, has a very sly, dry, and pithy way of putting sound truths, upon politics and manners, and whatever scheme we adopt, he will be a very useful and active ally in it, as he has a pleasure in writing quite inconceivable to a poor hack scribe like me, who always feel, about my art, as the French husband did when he found a man making love to his (the Frenchman's) wife:—' Comment, Monsieur,—sans y être obligé!' When I say this, however, I mean it only of the executive part of writing; for the imagining, the shadowing out of the future work is, I own, a delicious fool's paradise.
