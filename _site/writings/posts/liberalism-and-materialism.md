# liberalism and materialism

Sam and I were in the back of a taxi heading to Yerevan from Lake Sevan peninsula, and I had the opportunity (or created it) to extemporize on my project, as he is interested in collaborating. I will try to remember what I said, and attempt to organize it a posteriori. 

As I’ve written before, it’s materialism as a method for changing how others think. It’s Lucretius, Spinoza religion/spiritualism that connects Nature, Man, flora, and fauna. It is a beautiful way to exist, and I want others to understand how it can shape your lifestyle, your fears, your love, and your impact on others. How? Perhaps this is connected to yesterday’s writing, boiling down to what can liberals do? How is materialism (this is apparently what I’m calling it for now) connected to liberalism? So many questions! A lifetime to answer them. 

As I was telling Sam, I’m a scientist so I see the project from several facets that are connected by the theme just described. First, I am beginning to seriously study consciousness, the brain, and human experience from a mathematical-theoretical point of view. I don’t know yet where this will lead me, but it feels right. This path feels like a necessary route to working towards a better world from a mathematical point of view. In a nutshell, we are working to understand how the brain works because the brain is a similar system to many other systems. 

This leads me to a digression on what I see to be the prevailing scientific framework for contemporary thought: complex systems. Words are slippery, but that moniker, along with emergence, will serve our purposes. There is a worry here that we have begun to develop an all-encompassing lens— anything can be read as a complex system, so what is the purpose of a framework that is everything and each thing? The usefulness of the toolkit so far has been in highlighting the similarity (self-similarity) of systems across domains and scales. When we’re talking about cities, brains, the internet, social networks, banking— we have found interesting similarities in all of these systems. I say interesting, because we don’t know yet what to do with them. 

The answer to this question is twofold: predict and control. Modern digital technology is bent on prediction and control— we want to understand systems well enough to tell where they’re headed and how we can change that path. Sam was worried about this, for good reason, as understand the brain well enough and being able to control it sounds like some sort of brainwashing scheme. Well, it is. Whenever technology comes about that does something interesting, it will always be used for some evil deed, or have the propensity to do so. Think atomic weapons and atomic energy; think morphine and heroin. There seem to always be two sides to technology, but maybe this is just another dichotomy that can be dissolved. Maybe that dissolution is in fact our goal! So, Sam is right to be worried. 

Norbert Weiner wrote about this in three books, spanning the scientific-mathematical understanding of control systems, through their sociopolitical connections: Cybernetics, God & Golem, and Nature of Man (I think?). A project that must occur is to read and analyze these books, produce a short piece of criticism on them for a popular audience, and understand their relevance today. I don’t think his thoughts carry enough clout and should be further explored. My thought is that his grasp of the future of control theory in the context of human intellectual thought is more commanding than previously thought. 

So, that is an attempt at the first prong, the scientific prong. I am working on understanding the control principles associated with random networks, as I think these are the tools that will unlock the next stages in human scientific endeavor, across all domains from physics to poetics. Yes, it sounds kooky, but this is my belief. I also believe that this philosophy, if we can call it that, has incredible implications for changing human life and its interaction with our planet. This is why I’m writing. 

Let me explore that a bit, as it is the other half of my coin. My doing the science and applying it to brains, I’m working to understand better how we think and function, how we perform input-to-output operations given visual (in particular) data. How does our control system grow, organize, and function? How can it be altered, externally controlled? By understanding how the brain processes inputs, we can understand how choosing inputs changes how we perceive and act in the world. Right? This is Sam’s fear— if this is understood, we can control people. But we already do! Every input you choose, are bombarded with, produces an output. Your brain is still working whether or not you decide. The only thing you can choose, so to speak, to do is filter your inputs. The science is in infancy— for example, a breakthrough paper showed how certain light signals can lead to different brain outputs in rats, controlling how they run mazes. No in vivo, no surgeries, just flashing lights and behavioral changes. Think about television, smartphones, laptop screens. What effect is this artificial, controlled light producing as output? Who controls these inputs and what are their aims? What is an optimal trajectory for the forces that be? We’re getting conspiracy-theory-ish but it is food for thought. 

Now to quell Sam’s fear— we are going to continue conduction scientific research, as far as I can tell. We will figure things out about the brain, we will get better at controlling these systems and their related systems of different scales (brains—>cities—>insects—>internet—>corporations…). What are we not doing? We are using this lens of complexity to write about everything from management organization to anthills to poetry, but we’re not talking about the implications of this framework and the future of technological progress its overwhelming influence entails. This is the other side of the coin (I got there finally)— we need to write in the style of Drone Theory about complexity. State the current moment of complex systems theory, its philosophy and its concrete uses and discoveries. Next, flesh out the philosophical implications of such an overarching world-view, with special ties to ethics and politics. How do people use this theory to live better lives, but also how do they use it to profit and make the world more divided across financial and social spectra? 

This is incredibly broad, of course, but it will take a while. I think starting with a smaller niche, in the vein of something like Vibrant Matter is important to actually produce something readable and not purely speculative. I think combining Bennett’s list of thinkers as a philosophical framework while incorporating more contemporary thinkers from across realms is paramount to building a systems theory of systems theory, so to speak. Drone Theory for complex systems— what it is, what it means, where its going (or where it can go). It’s a must-do.
