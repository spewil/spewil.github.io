# lives of the objects 

Many mornings I wake up and stare at all the objects in my room. A striped shirt, vertical bars of blue and yellow and red that I bought at Goodwill almost four years ago. The sleeves only reach halfway down my forearms. Who made this shirt? Where? I look at my dresser, a plain wooden box with tall doors, stained. The moulding is simple, but it had to be designed, cute, carved, sanded… Who made this boudoir? Where? How did it get here? It was packaged, loaded, shipped, unloaded, placed in the room. The doors open and close every day, turning round their hinges. 

I quickly become overwhelmed with objects— shoes, desk, books, sweaters, pencils, coffee cups, carpet, lightbulbs, sheets, socks… each with their own story, their own subcomponents, their own designs. Some are singular, like the tiny Buddha statues I bought at a Chinese buffet restaurant in high-school on a science fair trip for good luck. Each one was hand-carved, and now they are chipped from falling off their surfaces. Others, like the socks, have large families, identical twins whose differences fall within quality control ranges, something like +/-0.5% tolerance. 

In the lives of these objects, how many minds have pondered, worried, dreamed, forgotten their conception, creation, and distribution? How much thought has gone into their creation? The material creation is the shaping, like a sand sculpture, of tiny components. The sweater has thousands of loops, each a strand of twisted fiber, each fiber a string of natural material, of proteins and amino acid chains… The sweater is thing, but it is a multitude. Is thought measured in loops or in chemical chains or in both or in neither? How long did someone think about the sweater? Who programmed the machine to knit the garment? Were they distracted? Is time a measurement of thought? Is thought measured in yarn? 

Each object spawns an infinite line of questioning. How much information is contained by an object, or can information be contained at all? Is information physical? Is information socks? How many socks is a thought, or how many thoughts is a sock? The Buddha statue— an ancient faith symbolized in a tiny wooden idol. Is this more information-heavy that the sock? If people worshipped socks for thousands of years would they hold the same amount of thought? Is information a currency? This is the engineer’s dream, the wonder of her work. We are information exchangers. We deal in information, and we produce material goods. We process, reduce, stretch and shift and sift objects to refine thoughts and create socks. We are overwhelmed by every interaction with an object. Who designed this? Why? We see the beauty in the everyday interaction— sipping coffee becomes a transcendent experience. The ceramic handle curves divinely in our fingers. 

The engineer connects the abstract to the concrete, sometimes literally. We live in a wonderland world of plastic objects formed from something unimaginable— a thought.
