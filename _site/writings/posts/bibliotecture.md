# bibliotecture

While reading the story of the rare book thief James Shinn, I couldn’t help but think how stale most libraries are. Even the Seattle library, one of the best I’ve visited, is still a warehouse of books. Borges-- the master meta-magician-- fabricates stories of infinite libraries and paradoxical volumes all crammed into a knots of narrative. But his fantasies, unlike other scientifico-technological fantasies, have not come close to bringing us new ways to read or experience the perusal of books. Why? I’m not sure.

What is my fantasy? Well, firstly, having enough concentration and freedom to read all day and write down my thoughts. A close second to this dream is some sort of experimental library. While wandering through the “stacks” (your tip-off right there, literal stacks of books, not very appealing) at the Cambridge library, I’m reminded of cattle cars or those commercials with the chickens stuffed into tiny cages. Let the books be free! I want a monument to the book, especially in an age where the written word seems so devalued, let the materiality of the volumes shine! There probably won’t be another Shinn, and this could be viewed as a good or bad thing. On one hand, I doubt we value books as highly as we used to, and I even more highly doubt that anyone would have the patience these days to steal books worth hundreds of thousands of dollars by living in cheap motels as opposed to buying a suit and working on Wall Street. On the other hand, part of me is sad to know that there won’t be many more book thieves— that’s how crazy I am about books. I want someone to want to steal them. They’re worth stealing! 

* An aside, and something that needs to be discussed: the idea of regret in a materialist world-view. Shinn is put in prison for 20 years for stealing over a million dollars worth of old books. I agree that discipline and punishment are useful forms of behavioral modification in most instances, but what is imprisonment from the materialist standpoint (not to mention the concept of theft…)? What is retribution in a deterministic, atomic universe? My understanding is that the judicial framework, like our collective, meta-human consciousness (yes, we are all a super-organism just get with it) is a learning entity. In a biological system some components must be quarantined, and perhaps even exterminated, but how this carries over into human interaction and policing is the debate. But my small point to raise here is “what is justice?” for a materialist? Maybe if I go back and read my Spinoza and my Lucretius I'll find something there. This has been an incredibly wordy way to pose the thought that there can be no fault, for everything is an interaction of forces in the world, and fault is a subjective mind’s creation of attribution, which becomes the basis for punishment. How do we reconcile the judicial system with this understanding (which I believe is exponentially spreading, an awareness contagion). Much, much more to discuss on this. * 

Of course there are bibliophiles out there much more zany than I imagine myself to be, but I want to focus more on the architecture and experience of perusing places of books— bibliotecture? Shelves and tabletops are where books live now. Why? Sometimes I have moments of intense anxiety where I realize that every object around me is perched on another object, if not on the ground, which is typically some structure affixed to the earth, itself balanced radially inward towards the center of our spherical spaceship. Think of creating a space where books come alive, because what’s inside of them is alive, right? Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got no clue what this looks like, I’m just asking the question of why there seems to exist some strong dichotomy between analog and digital. Reading is one of the most intensely pleasurable experiences that exists for humans, says me. Why have we not built shrines to its practice, to its fulfillment, to its artifacts and its preservation. Not a museum! I’m talking about a marketplace of reading. Not a trade floor! I’m talking a cathedral to books. But not a spiritual edifice, per se. 

Someone who thought about this, carried it out, and, I think, got it completely wrong, is architect Louis Khan. One of his finest constructions is the library at Phillips-Exeter Academy. In every single image you see of the spellbinding (no pun intended) building—-an incredible sculpture in light—- there are no books! It’s a library, man! I want total reading immersion, complete intellectual pleasure in a place. I don’t know what it looks like, I don’t know how to explain it, but I do know what I want. I bet Bachelard has something to say about this. I imagine culling a reading of Bachelard, Borges, and Louis Kahn with this concept in mind. We will see.
