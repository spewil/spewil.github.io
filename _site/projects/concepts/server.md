# plug-and-play server 

there is a lot of worry about who owns and uses our data-- for good reason. companies buy and sell our personal data, and this practice is quickly becoming a sort of technocratic supercapitalism. i believe that looking back, this will be as hard to understand as steel and newspaper monopolies of the early 20th century. 

there are many tools available to help protect yourself from have your personal information farmed and traded as wampum. for instance [this](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [this](http://www.myusbcloud.com/). 

my concept is similar to the second link. imagine a small piece of hardware that acts locally to store all of your data that you can access through a dropbox-like capability. this way, you know where all of your data is at all times, and you know where it isn't. you can run your email, your website, and all of those things from your home. the goal is privacy and control. apple has a [thing](https://www.apple.com/uk/airport-extreme/); it's too expensive, not cross-platform, and not customizable. because it's apple. 

of course, this is moving back to an earlier internet. but maybe that's not such a bad thing? 

there are a few things currently on the market. one such thing, being crowdfunded, is [this](https://daplie.com/products/server/), from a company called Daplie. however, there are a considerable amount of negative comments on the [funding page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/daplie-connecting-without-the-cloud-internet#/comments), mostly to do with pushing back the production date. this is a good lesson in manufacturing timeliness. perhaps we should always add a year to anything with a reasonable amount of complexity? 

interestingly, WD has [a product](https://www.wdc.com/en-gb/products/personal-cloud-storage.html) that is very similar to the Daplie device. however, you have to buy into WD's firmware, which seems to be [posing problems](https://community.wd.com/t/hosting-a-website-on-wd-my-cloud/94766/2) for some, as it is "not officially supported" by WD to run a website or email server from the device.

with these products, i think there is still plenty of room in the market for a "personal cloud" device for small businesses, mid-tier tinkerers, and people who want to own their own data. this could expand into distributed social networks, etc. the sky is the limit. one pitfall is the energy costs associated with personal servers. i wonder if a device could be made that extracts waste heat from your personal server to do soemthing useful, like contribute to your home's heating? some sort of micro-[trigeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration) scheme... 

food for thought.
