&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Experimental systems are precautions taken for the generation of spontaneous events. One has to look at them as places of emergence, as structures that have arisen from the development of the sciences in order to discover the unimaginable. They act like a spider web, in that they need to be able to catch everything, without the knowledge of what it is or where it comes from. It is an ensemble that is constantly under configuration and re-configuration, but is not systematically assembled as e.g. a car, in which every part is built to fit the next for it to work. Indeed, the process exists because there is no working car!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think artistic work is a practical way of relating to the world and just as activity driven as the sciences. In both cases, it is about pioneering the unknown: a step closer in exploring a topic, of which one does not yet know much. Therefore, the execution of research and the execution of artistic work are generally comparable activities. One engages oneself in an adventure with an uncertain outcome. […] Both are not to be understood as a teleological process, but rather the rejection of a current state, which leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the age of eighteen, I have been writing and never stopped, although I have also never made it my profession. The point for me, is not to express my innermost feelings, but to engage with a different material, namely language and words, and these can be very resistant. How they are arranged and what can be created with them are materially contingent processes to me. At their very end, things emerge, which one would not have thought of in the beginning, as they configure and originate only in the concrete handling of the word material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see those poems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/&quot;&gt;There’s no free will.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Further studies by Baumeister and colleagues have linked a diminished belief in free will to stress, unhappiness, and a lesser commitment to relationships. They found that when subjects were induced to believe that “all human actions follow from prior events and ultimately can be understood in terms of the movement of molecules,” those subjects came away with a lower sense of life’s meaningfulness. Early this year, other researchers published a study showing that a weaker belief in free will correlates with poor academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, Harris argues, as ordinary people come to better understand how their brains work, many of the problems documented by Vohs and others will dissipate. Determinism, he writes in his book, does not mean “that conscious awareness and deliberative thinking serve no purpose.” Certain kinds of action require us to become conscious of a choice—to weigh arguments and appraise evidence. True, if we were put in exactly the same situation again, then 100 times out of 100 we would make the same decision, “just like rewinding a movie and playing it again.” But the act of deliberation—the wrestling with facts and emotions that we feel is essential to our nature—is nonetheless real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on this soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade&quot;&gt;Tardigrades&lt;/a&gt;, AKA water bears, are virtually indestructible little creatures. I’m really curious about their brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking about where to by ecological cycling gear, it turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/cyclists-sustainable-ethical-cycling-gear-helmets-saddle&quot;&gt;cycling sustainability&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Former professional cyclist Francesca Barsamian says “durability and functionality is much more important to me than sustainability. All my accessories get heavy use and I have to know they’ll last. But because of that, I don’t buy things that often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it comes down to consumer choice, the most powerful tool in the marketplace…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/6345/do-photons-interact-with-each-other-or-with-themselves-only&quot;&gt;Peter Shor learns about photon-photon interactions.&lt;/a&gt; I really admire this humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now fascinated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System&quot;&gt;tariff codes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The HS is organized into 21 sections, which are subdivided into 96 chapters. The 96 HS chapters are further subdivided into approximately 5,000 headings and subheadings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By my count, that’s 10,080,000 codes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of functions: bijective, injective, and surjective, where a function is defined as a mapping between one set and another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The view that concepts (intensions) are the same as properties has been explicitly ad- vocated by Carnap (e.g., in Meaning and Neces- sity). This seems an unfortunate view, since “temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy” appears to be a perfectly good example of a true statement of identity of properties, whereas “the concept of temperature is the same concept as the concept of mean molecular kinetic energy” is simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; is a useful and interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Week 3</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">dynamics and function</title><link href="http://spewil.github.io/blog/neuro/dynamics-and-function/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="dynamics and function" /><published>2018-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://spewil.github.io/blog/neuro/dynamics-and-function</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://spewil.github.io/blog/neuro/dynamics-and-function/">&lt;p&gt;my dream is to apply neural organizational principles to understanding how people/groups organize

&lt;p&gt;this is the structure, this is the framework in which decisions are made. the anatomy of the brain is not static. it changes genetically, over evolutionary time scales, and the functional goings-on changes on many faster time scales of various length&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To understand reality, you have to understand how things work. If you do that, you can start to do engineering with it, build things. And if you can’t, whatever you’re doing probably isn’t good science. To me, engineering and science aren’t separate endeavors. It’s like, “Are you a husband or a father?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fJKbCXrCPwAR5wjL8/what-is-control-theory-and-why-do-you-need-to-know-about-it&quot;&gt;this train of thought&lt;/a&gt; has many flaws as a critique of the Bayesian brain, it does harp on something I’ve been thinking about with respect to the “extended mind” thesis of Chalmers and Clark. Thermostats &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; acting, or perhaps reacting, to environmental stimuli and adjusting their internal state according to a rule. We do, in fact, think that the brain’s ability to do whatever it does hinges on its recurrence, its ability to excite and inhibit itself and to change these patterns of excitation and inhibition dynamically. Are we fancy thermostats? I would say no, but I will believe that it’s worth thinking about why not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If, as is speculated, a living organism’s brain is a collection of control systems, is Bayescraft no more related to its physical working than arithmetic is? Our brains can learn to do arithmetic, but arithmetic is not how our brains work. Likewise, we can learn Bayescraft, or some practical approximation to it, but do Bayesian processes have anything to do with the mechanism of brains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would usually bring a book of my images so I could show them my work. I’d share my website with them. I’d say, “This is my style” and then all of a sudden they’d seem to understand that I wasn’t just asking them to pose and smile. I need them to trust me and forget me. I really want them to be comfortable in their own environment. It’s not really a pose. I want them to be themselves. So I need them to relax. To do that, I spent many hours with them. I never just showed up to take photographs and then went away. I hung out and talked to them…a lot. I didn’t just want to take a photo of them, I wanted to actually know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between fast twitch muscles (light meat) and slow twitch muscles (dark meat) is based on their methods of making energy– aerobically and anaerobically. Fast twitch, able to contract quickly but over a short duration, rely on anaerobic respiration and thus don’t require access to lots of oxygen-rich blood (hence the lightness). Slow twitch contract more slowly but over longer durations, are blood-rich (therefore dark) and use aerobic respiration. The body has a mixture of fast and slow twitch muscles depending on purposes. In training your body, there is a trade-off between (re)building fast and slow twitch muscles. One tends to lose fast twitch (think about a weightlifter) when one trains aerobically (think of a runner, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before you were doing music full-time, you ran a barbershop where you once bought over a million dollars in counterfeit money from some scared kids for $2,000…&lt;/em&gt;
We had to make it look used, so we crumpled it up, dipped it in coffee and then dried it. We furnished the barbershop with new gear; we passed it out around the community; we paid for studio time and cut a lot of records too. I would tell people it was counterfeit and just give them twice as much. [laughs] Then it was up to them to get rid of it. Once the police became aware, we threw the rest of it away – about $200,000 at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitxela.com/projects/thermal_paper_polaroid&quot;&gt;thermal paper Polaroid&lt;/a&gt; camera… cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation recently about time dilation and relativity. The difficulty in explaining why time dilates (or stretches) lies in finding a good metaphor for understanding things like the twin paradox. Why is the speedy twin still young? Because relativity hinges on time and space unifying as a spacetime, the “fabric” of the universe, we can use our experience of geometries and time to get some experiential understanding of how spacetime is traversed and can lead to dilations. Imagine two runners. One is on the inside lane and the other on the outside. They both start at the same local time, and they’re both holding stop watches. Let’s say they are equally matched, so the inside runner finishes first, and stops her watch. The outside runner stops his watch when he finishes, and shows a longer time. If they are equally matched, why is the outside runner slower? Obviously his lane is slightly longer than hers, giving her an advantage. This is a similar concept to time dilation in space time. As events traverse spacetime, with it’s bends and warps, we find similar cases where the only explanation is the substrate of the events, the race track, itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/reinventing-america/556856/?single_page=true&quot;&gt;this Atlantic piece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the mismatch between local and national perceptions of America differ, the authors argue, in the following realms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Manufacturing
-Schools
-Talent Dispersal
-Immigration 
-Civic Governance
-Conservation
-Downtowns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Libraries might seem fated to become the civic counterparts of yesteryear’s Borders or Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, but in nearly every city we visited they were newly prominent. By most measures of use—classes and programs offered, daily attendance, visits to the website, everything except calls to reference librarians for the research people can now do on Google—libraries are becoming more rather than less popular and central to civic life. The soft measures of impact are powerful: Walk into a random public library, and you’ll see waiting lines for computers, librarians helping with job searches or other practical concerns, desk space for young entrepreneurs. According to a recent Pew survey, Millennials use libraries more than their Gen X or Boomer elders do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dysfunction at the national level genuinely is a problem, as the world is reminded every time the federal government shuts down. Some of that pathology has spread to the state level. But for us the American story was of a country that is still capable of functioning far more effectively than national-level paralysis would indicate or than most people unaware of the national patterns we are reporting would assume about the parts of America they’re not in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Early in our travels I received a note from a young man who had moved from a big coastal city to a town in North Texas. “If you want to consume a fabulous community, you could move to some place like Brooklyn,” he said—or San Francisco, or Seattle, or Paris, or Amsterdam, or any other glittering site with restaurants, parks, vistas, and public spaces to enjoy. “If you want to create a great community, you move someplace that needs your help,” like his new hometown. Creating in this sense means taking responsibility for the invention and sustenance of the community in which you’d like to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity Theory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kripke, &lt;em&gt;Naming and Necessity&lt;/em&gt;, 1972&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The trouble is that the identity theorist does not hold that the physical state merely produces the mental state, rather he wishes the two to be identical and thus a fortiori necessarily co-occurrent. In the case of molecular motion and heat there is something, namely, the sensation of heat, which is an intermediary between the external phenomenon and the observer. In the mental-physical case no such intermediary is possible, since here the physical phenomenon is supposed to be identical with the internal phenomenon itself. Someone can be in the same epistemic situation as he would be if there were heat, even in the absence of heat, simply by feeling the sensation of heat; and even in the presence of heat, he can have the same evidence as he would have in the absence of heat simply by lacking the sensation S. No such possibility exists in the case of pain and other mental phenomena. To be in the same episternic situation that would obtain if one had a pain is to have a pain; to be in the same epistemic situation that would obtain in the absence of a pain is not to have a pain. The apparent contingency of the connection between the mental state and the corresponding brain state thus cannot be explained by some sort of qualitative analogue as in the case of heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kripke argues that the heat as molecular motion or lightning as electrical discharge analogies for mental states like pain are not the whole story because what doesn’t compute is the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of heat, lightning, or pain. Something can be hot without being felt as such, but nothing can be pain(ed, ful, etc) without being felt. The experience of pain (fear, etc) must be mediated by a feeling being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;God had to do some work, in addition to making the man himself, to make a certain man be the inventor of bifocals; the man could well exist without inventing any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line of Kripke’s I don’t find very persuasive. The epistemic conditions do not imply ontological ones (like Rorty says). The man who invented bifocals is Bejamin Franklin, and I might know him as one, both, or neither. This is still the same man regardless of my epistemic condition. There is no ontological distinction between these men, even if he had not invented anything! This might sound bold, but in my view this analogy is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.J.C Smart, &lt;em&gt;Sensations and Brain Processes&lt;/em&gt;, 1959&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…when I “report” a pain, I am not really reporting anything (or, if you like, I am reporting in a queer sense of “reporting”), but am doing a sophisticated sort of wince.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart follows Wittgenstein here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wish to resist saying “I have a yellowish orange after-image” is to report something irreducibly psychical.
Why do I wish to resist this suggestion? Mainly because of Occam’s razor. It seems to me that science is increasingly giving us a viewpoint whereby organisms are able to be seen as physico-chemical mechanisms: 4 it seems that even the behavior of man himself will one day be explicable in mechanistic terms. There does seem to be, so far as science is concerned, nothing in the world but increasingly complex arrangements of physical constituents. All except for one place: in consciousness. That is, for a full description of what is going on in a man you would have to mention not only the physical processes in his tissue, glands, nervous system, and so forth, but also his states of consciousness: his visual, auditory, and tactual sensations, his aches and pains. That these should be correlated with brain processes does not help, for to say that they are correlated is to say that they are something “over and above.” You cannot correlate something with itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find these lines very compelling. I know there is more to the story here, but it is a good start. Kripke’s problems still hold, as Smart cannot hold up his physical analogies and easily brush off internal &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…roughly, biology is to physics as radio-engineering is to electro-magnetism) except the occurrence of sensations seems to me to be frankly unbelievable. Such sensations would be “nomological danglers,” to use Feigl’s expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to hold up such a blatant reductionism these days, but I do understand the urge to limit any dangling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I find Wittgenstein’s position (as I construe it) congenial. For on this view there are, in a sense, no sensations. A man is a vast arrangement of physical particles, but there are not, over and above this, sensations or states of consciousness. There are just behavioral facts about this vast mechanism, such as that it ex- presses a temptation (behavior disposition) to say “there is a yellowish-red patch on the wall” or that it goes through a sophisticated sort of wince, that is, says “I am in pain.” Admittedly Wittgenstein says that though the sensation “is not a something,” it is nevertheless “not a noth- ing either” (paragraph 304), but this need only mean that the word “ache” has a use. An ache is a thing, but only in the innocuous sense in which the plain man, in the first paragraph of Frege’s Foundations o f Arithmetic, answers the question “what is the number one?” by “a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sensations are nothing over and above brain processes. Nations are nothing “over and above” citizens, but this does not prevent the logic of nation statements being very different from the logic of citizen statements, nor does it insure the translatability of nation statements into citizen statements. (I do not, however, wish to assert that the relation of sensation statements to brain-process statements is very like that of nation statements to citizen statements. Nations do not just happen to be nothing over and above citizens, for example. I bring in the “nations” example merely to make a negative point: that the fact that the logic of A-statements is differ- ent from that of B-statements does not insure that A’s are anything over and above B’s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I say that the successful general is the same person as the small boy who stole the apples I mean only that the successful general I see before me is a time sliceS of the same four-dimensional object of which the small boy stealing apples is an earlier time slice. However, the four-dimensional ob- ject which has the general-I-see-before-me for its late time slice is identical in the strict sense with the four-dimensional object which has the small-boy-stealing-apples for an early time slice. I distinguish these two senses of “is iden- tical with” because I wish to make it clear that the brain-process doctrine asserts identity in the strict sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Parfit do with this line of thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sense-datum, or at least the having of the sense-datum, the “look” of lightning, may well in my view be a correlate of the electric discharge. For in my view it is a brain state caused by the lightning. But we should no more confuse sensations of lightning with lightning than we confuse sensations of a table with the table. […] An illiterate peasant might well be able to talk about his sensations without knowing about his brain processes, just as he can talk about lightning though he knows nothing of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this Wittgenstein view can indeed take us a long way, and it means something for neuroscience. What is this language game? Let’s put aside the question for the moment of how brains process language, let’s assume that they have a black box machine for turning words into brain states. It is more interesting to ask why certain words developed, namely these internal state words (pain, love, fear). Every brain is different in every time instant. These words are containers of similarity for communicating brains. Abstraction is the ability to generalize similarity, to inhibit concreteness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fido theory of meaning. If the mean- ing of an expression were what the expression named, then of course it would follow from the fact that “sensation” and “brain-process” have different meanings that they cannot name one and the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart makes mention of generalizations or “secondary properties”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This account of secondary qualities explains their unimpor- tance in physics. For obviously the discrimina- tions and lack of discriminations made by a very complex neurophysiological mechanism are hardly likely to correspond to simple and nonar- bitrary distinctions in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Raw feels, in my view, are colorless for the very same rea- son that something is colorless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication, Smart says, works like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is some- thing going on which is like what is going on when…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So far we have not given sense to talk of experi- ences as swift or slow, straight or circular. But I am not claiming that “experience” and “brain- process” mean the same or even that they have the same logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The language of introspective reports has a different logic from the language of material processes. It is obvious that until the brain-process theory is much improved and widely accepted there will be no criteria for saying “Smith has an experience of such-and- such a sort” except Smith’s introspective re- ports. So we have adopted a rule of language that (normally) what Smith says goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can imagine myself turned to stone and yet having images, aches, pains, and so on.&lt;/em&gt; All the objection shows is that “experi- ence” and “brain-process” do not have the same meaning. It does not show that an experience is not in fact a brain process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The issue between the brain-process theory and epiphenomenalism seems to be of the above sort. (Assuming that a behavioristic reduction of introspective reports is not possible.) If it be agreed that there are no cogent philosophical ar- guments which force us into accepting dualism, and if the brain process theory and dualism are equally consistent with the facts, then the prin- ciples of parsimony and simplicity seem to me to decide overwhelmingly in favor of the brain- process theory. As I pointed out earlier, dualism involves a large number of irreducible psy- chophysical laws (whereby the “nomological danglers” dangle) of a queer sort, that just have to be taken on trust, and are just as difficult to swallow as the irreducible facts about the pale- ontology of the earth with which we are faced on Philip Gosse’s theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of “social hope”; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation, constitutes the crucial concept of a “postphilosophical” culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist naturalism that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Understand that you cannot duplicate your parent’s household immediately. It took them 20-30 years to get there. You are just starting out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Get out and stay out of consumer debt (this includes student loans and car payments)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Then start investing some money in low-cost mutual funds.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Save an emergency fund (3-6 months)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Buy a modest home (15-year mortgage 10-20% down)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if I want to buy something, which is often, I always put it on my list. After some time, I can decide if that thing will improve the quality of my life, and it is within my means to buy it. ‘within my means’ is a budgeting problem that’s in a process of constant revision. the important point here is that nothing is cheap– as with all relative transactions, what you include in your system of transaction matters. that’s not to argue naively for a zero-sum economic game, but perhaps there is some ethical conservation law…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we learned from traveling was not that the hardest American challenges of this era are illusory. They’re very real, and divisions about national politics are intense. So we made a point of never asking, early on, “How’s Obama doing?,” or later, “Do you trust Hillary?” and “What about Trump?” The answers to questions like those won’t take you beyond what you’ve already heard ad nauseam on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead we asked people about their own lives and their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Relentlessly prune bullshit, don’t wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That’s what you do when life is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky&quot;&gt;Finding your baboons?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1978, Sapolsky received his B.A. in biological anthropology summa cum laude from Harvard University.[8] He then went to Kenya to study the social behaviors of baboons in the wild; after which he returned to New York; studying at Rockefeller University, where he received his Ph.D. in neuroendocrinology working in the lab of endocrinologist Bruce McEwen.
Following Sapolsky’s initial year-and-a-half field study in Africa, he returned every summer for another twenty-five years to observe the same group of baboons, from the late 70s to the early 90s. He spent 8 to 10 hours a day for approximately four months each year recording the behaviors of these primates.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have this idea of &lt;em&gt;raw material&lt;/em&gt;. often (continental) philosophers use literature, poetry, and film as currency in arguments. language is borrowed from art as material to build rhetoric, to color examples. in the same way, scientists have raw material, they have experiences documenting the social habits of baboons, they have data from microscopes and sensors. we all have raw material in the way of experience. choosing experiences, making choices that lead to transformations in the world lead to changes in experience. what i am working to do is reflect on these experiences, use them as &lt;em&gt;raw material&lt;/em&gt; to craft new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Invention of the Mind” (Rorty 1979)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;universals and particulars are cut as mental and physical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wittgenstein— universals are contextual, within the language game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;neural correlations could give us thoughts, mental images, etc
	the hard problems is the particular one— one are YOUR feelings like?
	to solve it is usually to create a bugbear– to swap brains, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even if neural correlations didn’t work, why make immaterial things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the ontological gap is actually an epistemic privilege problem 
	YOUR thoughts are incorrigible, undoubtable 
	(cool connection wth skepticism here, solipsism)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rorty tries to understand why we have a mind-body problem, tracing the “problem” through from the ancients to contemporary neo-dualist arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So when Ryle suggests that to talk of mental entities is to talk of dispositions to behave, or when Smart suggests that it is to talk of neural states, they have two strikes against them. For why, if anything like behaviorism or materialism is true, should there be anything like this intuitive distinction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wittgenstein and Strawson that in some sense there is nothing there but the human organism, and that we must give up the notion of this organism as made out of a bit of &lt;em&gt;res cogitans&lt;/em&gt; nonspatially associated with a bit of &lt;em&gt;res extensa&lt;/em&gt;. But, they say, no scientiﬁc discovery can reveal an identity This intuition seems to them enough to establish an unbridgeable gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this situation, it is tempting for the dualist to go linguistic and begin talking about “different vocabularies” or “alternative descriptions.” [e.g. Spinoza’s double-aspect theory] The question “two descriptions of what?” makes this a difﬁcult position to hold onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have the following dilemma: either neo-dualists must construct an epistemological account of how we know a priori that entities fall under two irreducibly distinct ontological species, or else they must ﬁnd some way of expressing their dualism which relies on neither the notion of “ontological gap” nor that of “alternative description.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We feel vaguely conﬁdent that if the inﬁnite could exist, it, like the universal, could only be exempliﬁed by the immaterial. If it makes any sense to speak of the existence of universals, it would seem that they must exist immaterially, and that is why they can never be identiﬁed with spatio—temporal particulars. […] Nevertheless the opposite of “mental” is “physical” and the opposite of “immaterial” is “material.” “Physical” and “material” seem synonymous. How can two distinct concepts have synonymous opposites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is spatiotemporal? Why is it useful? What is a spatial or non-spatial state? Freeze time, we say, and they analyze the spatial structure, like in a photograph. But a photograph is dependent on time. It is useful only because of this time instant relative to other time instants, in a time-context. This might be what Deleuze is talking about with &lt;em&gt;movement-image&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;time-image&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are not entitled to begin talking about the mind-body problem, or about the possible identity or necessary non-identity of mental and physical states, without ﬁrst asking what we mean by “mental.” I would hope further to have incited the suspicion that our soocalled intuition about what is mental may be merely our readiness to fall in with a speciﬁcally philosophical language-game. I think that this socalled intuition is no more than the ability to command a certain technical vocabulary—one which has no use outside of philosophy books and which links up with no issues in daily life, empirical science, morals, or religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To say that we cannot observe intentional properties by looking at the brain is like saying that we cannot see a proposition when we look at a Mayan codex—we simply do not know what to look for, because we do not yet know how to relate what we see to a symbolsystem. The relation between an inscription—on paper or, given the hypothesized concomitance, in the brain—and what it means is no more mysterious than the relation between a functional state of a person, such as his beauty or his health, and the parts of his body. It is just those parts seen in a given context. So the answer to the question “Why is the intentional nonmaterial?” is “because any functional state—any state which can only be grasped by relating what is observed to a larger context—is, in a trivial sense, nonmaterial.” The problem is in trying to relate this trivial notion of being “nonmaterial”—which means merely something like “not immediately evident to all who look”—with the philosophically pregnant sense of “immateriality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To put it another way, why should we be troubled by Leibniz’s point that if the brain were blown up to the size of a factory, so that we could stroll through it, we should not see thoughts? If we know enough neural correlations, we shall indeed see thoughts—in the sense that our vision will reveal to us what thoughts the possessor of the brain is having. If we do not, we shall not, but then if we stroll through any factory without having ﬁrst learned about its parts and their relations to one another, we shall not see ‘what is going on. Further, even if we could ﬁnd no such neural correlations, even if cerebral localization of thoughts was a complete failure, why would we want to say that a person’s thoughts or mental images were nonphysical simply because we cannot give an account of them in terms of his parts? To use an example from Hilary Putnam, one cannot give an account of why square pegs do not ﬁt into round holes in terms of the elementary particles which constitute the peg and the hole, but nobody ﬁnds a perplexing ontological gap between macrostructure and microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do some neo-dualist philosophers say that how something feels, what it is like to be something, cannot be identical with any physical property, or at least any physical property which we know anything about? A trivial answer to this question would be that we can know all about something’s physical properties and not know how it feels-—especially if we can’t talk to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why should this epistemic distinction reﬂect an ontological distinction? Why should the epistemic privilege we all have of being incorrigible about how things seem to us reﬂect a distinction between two realms of being? The answer presumably has to go something like this: Feelings just are appearances. Their reality is exhausted in how they seem. They are pure seemings. Anything that is not a seeming (putting the intentional to one side for the moment) is merely physical—that is, it is something which can appear other than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are our intuitions wrong? Are we not always completely seeming, swimming through a pool of air and dust? Is the only pure state the ground state of quantum mechanics-the vacuum state? We cannot think in vacuum, can we? What is thought, belief, desire, love &lt;em&gt;in vacuo&lt;/em&gt;? Pain, the mental, being made of mind-stuff, or the forcing of argument to this point misunderstands what the mental is and is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The neo-dualist is no longer talking about how people feel but about feelings as little self-subsistent entities, ﬂoating free of people in the way in which universals ﬂoat free of the instantiations. He has, in fact, modeled pains on universals. It is no wonder, then, that he can “intuit” that pains can exist separately from the body, for this intuition is simply the intuition that universals can exist independently of particulars. […] To put it oxymoronically, mental particulars, unlike mental states of people, turn out to be universals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do we think of the phenomenal as immaterial? We do so because, as Ryle put it, we insist on thinking of having a pain in ocular metaphors—as having a funny sort of par.ticular before the eye of the mind. That particular turns out to be a universal, a quality hypostatized into a subject of predication. Thus when neo-dualists say that how pains feel are essential to what pains are, and then criticize Smart for thinking of the causal role of certain neurons as what is essential to pain, they are changing the subject. Smart is talking about what is essential to people being in pain, whereas neo-dualists like Kripke are talking about what is essential for something’s being a pain. Neo-dualists feel unafraid of the question “What is the epistemological basis for your claim to know what is an essential property of pain?” for they have arranged things so that pains have only one intrinsic property—namely, feeling painful—and so the choice of which properties are to count as essential to them is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mental-physical distinction is parasitic on the universal-particular distinction. Further, the notion of mind-stuff as that out of which pains and beliefs are made makes exactly as much or as little sense as the notion of “that of which universals are made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following Wittgenstein, we shall treat the intentional as merely a subspecies of the functional, and the functional as merely the sort of property whose attribution depends upon a knowledge of context rather than being observable right off the bat. We shall see the intentional as having no connection with the phenomenal, and the phenomenal as a matter of how we talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as the patient needs to relive his past to answer his questions, so philosophy needs to relive its past in order to answer its questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In my Wittgensteinian view, an intuition is never anything more or less than familiarity with a language—game, so to discover the source of our intuitions is to relive the history of the philosophical language-game we ﬁnd ourselves playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us call the “problem of personhood” that of what more a human being is than ﬂesh. This problem has one form in the pre-philosophical craving for immortality, and another in the Kantian and romantic assertion of human dignity—but both cravings are quite distinct from problems about consciousness and about knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem of consciousness centers around the brain, raw feels, and bodily motions. The problem of reason centers around the topics of knowledge, language, and intelligence—all our “higher powers.” The problem of personhood centers around attributions of freedom and of moral responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Philosophy undertook to examine the difference between knowing that there were parallel mountain ranges to the west and knowing that inﬁnitely extended parallel lines never meet, the difference between knowing that Socrates was good and knowing what goodness was. So the question arose: What are the analogies between knowing about mountains and knowing about lines, between knowing Socrates and knowing the Good? When this question was answered in terms of the distinction between the eye of the body and the Eye of the Mind, νους–thought, intellect, insight—-was identiﬁed as what separates men from beasts. There was, we moderns may say with the ingratitude of hindsight, no particular reason why this ocular metaphor seized the imagination of the founders of Western thought. But it did, and contemporary philosophers are still working out its consequences, analyzing the problems it created, and asking whether there may not be something to it after all. The notion of “contemplation,” of knowledge of universal concepts or truths as θεωρία, makes the Eye of the Mind the inescapable model for the better sort of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;froghood  = skimming off the universal from the clearly known particular frog, so to speak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our Glassy Essence; It is glassy—mirror-like—for two reasons. First, it takes on new forms without being changed—but intellectual forms, rather than sensible ones as material mirrors do. Second, mirrors are made of a substance which is purer, ﬁner grained, more subtle, and more delicate than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The image of our Glassy Essence remains with us, as does Isabella’s lament that we cannot grasp it. A sense of moral failure mixes with a sense of grievance that philosophy—the discipline supremely concerned with “the higher”—has not made us more aware of our own nature. That nature, it is still felt, makes its distinctive character most clearly felt in a certain sort of knowledge—knowledge of the highest and purest things: mathematics, philosophy itself, theoretical physics, anything which contemplates universals. To suggest that there are no universals—that they are ﬂatus vocis—is to endanger our uniqueness. To suggest that the mind is the brain is to suggest that we secrete theorems and symphonies as our spleen secretes dark humors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Aristotle’s conception intellect is not a mirror inspected by an inner eye. It is both mirror and eye in one. The retinal image is itself the model for the “intellect which becomes all things,” whereas in the Cartesian model, the intellect inspects entities modeled on retinal images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The difﬁculty is in ﬁnding a Greek equivalent for “sensation” in the sense philosophers make it bear. . . . “Sensation” was introduced into philosophy precisely to make it possible to speak of a conscious state without committing oneself as to the nature or even existence of external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Importantly, there had been no term, even of philosophical art, in the Greek and medieval traditions coextensive with the Descartes-Locke use of “idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Aristotle, the faculty which received universals without embodying them in matter was “separable” and it was hard (without some help from extra-philosophical concerns, such as Christianity) to say whether one should view it as 1) a special power which the body had, 2) a separate substance attached to each mature human body, or perhaps 3) a single substance which was somehow shared among as many men and angels as there happened to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Descartes will admit only three substances—thought, extension, and God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“argument from doubt:” what we can doubt exists cannot, by Leibniz’s law, be identical with what we cannot doubt exists. this argument is “universally recognized to be fallacious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If I am right in thinking that Descartes’s badly argued hunch, the one which made him able to see pains and thoughts as modes of a single substance, was that indubitability was the common factor they shared with nothing physical, then we can see him as working his way around toward a view in which indubitability is no longer the mark of eternality, but rather of something for which the Greeks had no name—consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Cartesian change from mind-as-reason to mind-as-inner-arena was not the triumph of the prideful individual subject freed from scholastic shackles so much as the triumph of the quest for certainty over the quest for wisdom. From that time. forward, the way was open for philosophers either to attain the rigor of the mathematician or the mathematical physicist, or to explain the appearance of rigor in these ﬁelds, rather than to help people attain peace of mind. Science, rather than living, became philosophy’s subject, and epistemology its center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The notion which would deﬁne what could “have a distinct existence from the body” was one which would draw a line between the cramps in one’s stomach and the associated feeling in one’s mind. I have suggested that the only criterion which will draw this line is indubitability—that closeness to the Inner Eye which permits Descartes to say that “nothing is easier for the mind to know than itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems plausible to say that Descartes’s insight was merely a recognition of the difference between parts of persons or states of those parts (e.g., cramps of their stomachs) on the one hand and certain states of the whole person on the other, misleadingly stated in a corrupted scholastic vocabulary as a distinction of “substance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My answer to the question “Why do we tend to lump the intentional and the phenomenal together as ‘the mental’?” is that Descartes used the notion of the “incorrigibly known” to bridge the gap between them. So I now need to spell out more fully my own anti-Cartesian, Wittgensteinian, view of the nature of “our privileged access to the mental.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I shall try to show that the purportedly metaphysical “problem of consciousness” is no more and no less than the epistemological “problem of privileged access,” and that once this is seen questions about dualism versus materialism lose their interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refs: 
Richard Rorty, “Incorrigibility as the Mark of the Mental,” Journal of Philosophy 67 (1970), 406-409&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Hylomorphism’ is simply a compound word composed of the Greek terms for matter (hulê) and form or shape (morphê); thus one could equally describe Aristotle’s view of body and soul as an instance of his “matter-formism.” That is, when he introduces the soul as the form of the body, which in turn is said to be the matter of the soul, Aristotle treats soul-body relations as a special case of a more general relationship which obtains between the components of all generated compounds, natural or artifactual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;’’'’soul : body :: form : matter :: Hermes-shape : bronze’’’’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aristotle thinks that Plato and other dualists are right to stress the importance of the soul in explanations of living beings. At the same time, he sees their commitment to the separability of the soul from the body as unjustified merely by appeal to formal causation: he will allow that the soul is distinct from the body, and is indeed the actuality of the body, but he sees that these concessions by themselves provide no grounds for supposing that the soul can exist without the body. His hylomorphism, then, embraces neither reductive materialism nor Platonic dualism. Instead, it seeks to steer a middle course between these alternatives by pointing out, implicitly, and rightly, that these are not exhaustive options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, he insists that because various psychological states, including anger, joy, courage, pity, loving, and hating, all involve the body in central and obvious ways, the study of soul “is already in the province of the natural scientist”. At the same time, however, he insists that the mind or intellect (nous) may not be enmeshed in the body in the same way as these sorts of states, and so denies that the study of soul falls in its entirety to the natural scientist. This is presumably why in the opening chapter of De Anima Aristotle reports a deep and authentic perplexity about the best method for investigating psychological matters. If different sciences employ different methods and the study of soul is bifurcated so that it belongs to no one science, there will indeed be a genuine difficulty about how best to proceed in any inquiry concerning it. It seems fair to say that these sorts of quandaries have not left us altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Wittgensteinian reformulation, the Hermes-shape is a Hermes-shape only in the context of our language game. If someone did not recognize Hermes, they might say “man-shape” in his stead, thus appealing to a more general game. Form embodies concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;’’'’S thinks O if and only if: (i) S has the capacity requisite for receiving O’s intelligible form; (ii) O acts upon that capacity by enforming it; and, as a result, (iii) S’s relevant capacity becomes isomorphic with that form.’’’’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the same questions which arose in the case of perception also arise here. Most immediately, to understand Aristotle’s approach to thinking, it is necessary to determine what it means to say that a thinker’s mind and its object become isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one reason that I connected so strongly with Spinoza (and why I imagine most philosophers have connected with his work at one time or another regardless of their philosophical, political, or personal stance) was his ability to lay out the feeling I have have when reading, learning, and listening. Spinoza’s &lt;em&gt;conatus&lt;/em&gt; sums up, for me, the inexplicable urge I have to do most things (including writing this). This striving, as its often translated, is, Spinoza explains, for pushing us (thinking things) towards planes of higher reason. Joy, he says, is understanding how things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, looking back, I chose engineering. Study how things work? Sign me up. That worked well for a while, but it’s hard to map engine thermodynamics to feelings of love, fear, and pain. To move towards a truly higher plane of reason, to understand our &lt;em&gt;selves&lt;/em&gt;, we need something using the tools of engineering, mathematics, yes, but also the painstaking observation of biologists, ecologists, and psychologists– science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have always been two &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important topics for me when it comes to make human life more livable: education and health. I figured that one day, through some nice invention, I would be able to break into one, or both, of these realms. Many have done this, with great success. However, working within a captitalist value structure, success is too-often valued on market share and returns on investment. My &lt;em&gt;conatus&lt;/em&gt; became focused on understanding how decisions are made, and how decisionmaking is affected by this system of abstract values relative to concrete values like health, knowledge, and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, neuroscience combines learning, education, and knowledge– the &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt;– with the science of this education. Health is a large container. I believe that the &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt; prefix could be attached to anything, and has been (neuroethics, neurolaw, neuroengineering, neuroeconomics…). Soon it will be dropped and neuroscience will become ubiquitous in our movement toward reason. My hope, my mission, is for neuroscience to allocate resources towards lifting the burden of abstract values from our thinking, and concretize our experience by rooting it in the impossibly complex biilogy of our selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is uniquely capable of communicating something to people about their selves without generalizing their experience. I met a woman at a dinner a few nights ago, and gave her a short version of these disparate thoughts. She said, “Wow, that is a fantastic goal. I always wanted to be a neuroscientist you know. I had this feeling that it could help me lead a better life. I went with economics, though. I still question that.” I gave her a honest (albeit hokey) response about how everyone is a neuroscientist &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; because every person has unique access to their internal mental experience. “You know,” she said, “I had a premature son, very premature, and I wished I had studied neuroscience so that I could better understand his experience, to know why is the way he is today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences are the unique cases that neuroscience will help. We know so little about ourselves at present, it reminds me of Copernicus being shunned for scientifically refuting the geocentric model of the heavenly bodies. We’re still in the anything-goes time of this field. This makes it overwhelming, but with time we will come to learn so much about ourselves that on more than one occassion a colleague will sigh and admit, “I’m worried who will use this and for what.” My naive hope is that by teaching human beings about the biological basis of their behaviors, we will work towards an imminence that Spinoza described: &lt;em&gt;Deus sive Natura&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Freud was a neuroscientist, wasn’t he? Just not a very good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleuze, a Spinozist of sorts, drives it home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not to psychoanalysis or linguistics but to the biology of the brain that we should look for principles, because it doesn’t have the drawback, like the other two disciplines, of drawing on ready-made concepts. We can consider the brain as a relatively undifferentiated mass and ask what circuits . . . the movement-image or the time-image trace out, or invent, because the circuits aren’t there to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for fun, note that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as “buggery (enculage)”, as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls “percepts” and “affects”), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero (which Deleuze calls “functives”). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:[35] they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, “separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another.”[36] For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as “is it true?” or “what is it?”, Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: “what does it do?” or “how does it work?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deleuze’s key ideas: There is, for example, his famous point that philosophy is the creation of concepts. Without the creation of new concepts, there can be no thinking with a difference, no line of flight in thought. Second, and closely related to this, Deleuze proposed that concepts are tools of analysis, not recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, where do we begin? What questions are the ones worth asking. Wittgenstein, so I’m told, said that what is more interesting that interesting answers are interesting questions. This is why I can’t stop writing and running around with philosophers. Sartre does it best when he (I can’t find the source) knocks engineering as profession in relation to philosophers. I won’t say I’m sold on this critique, but his underlying principle is sound (and should go for engineers as well, if possible…): problem-solving is a myth and a curse. Problems are meant to be posed as questions are meant to be asked. Answers are an ideal and there are no absolutes, only situations. Hence Deleuze’s buggery. By creating new questions we strive towards understanding. By “solving” problems we fool ourselves into thinking we moving towards more order– “If I could just solve this problem…”. This leads to an interpretation of control. Control theory is definining a system and a goal as a problem to be solved. By creating contexts, fields of controllability perhaps, we attempt to build local pockets of order. But that’s for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our questions should produce difficulties, should create problems. I see &lt;em&gt;What-type&lt;/em&gt; questions, &lt;em&gt;How-type&lt;/em&gt; questions, and &lt;em&gt;Why-type&lt;/em&gt; questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the atom of brain computation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such what-type questions are exploratory in nature. What’s out there, what parts does this thing have, what makes it tick. Think about taking apart a watch and cataloging all of the springs, cogs, and gears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is the brain organized? How does the structure of the brain give rise to complex computations?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does the brain control itself? Is it controlled by phenomena/sensation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does “innate” behavior change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such questions are wholly scientific. How does X work? Let’s perturb X and see what happens, record this happening, and devise a theory to explain the changes. Let’s guess how X works, devise a controlled perturbation, and see if the results match with our guess. If I replace a spring from the watch with a stiffer counterpart, will it tick slowly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does a neuron spike?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are there so many loops in structural brain connections?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many why-type questions have interesting evolutionary answers. We use language because we’re social. We’re social because we strive to survive against predators and natural events. We need to control our muscles so we can move. We need to move so we can find food. We need food so we can survive. It goes on like this. The trick, I think, is to pick your why-type question far enough upstream that you can figure something out before reaching the “because we need to survive” terminus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I am studying neuroscience. I have the hope that by communcating a biologico-chemico-computational understanding of our &lt;em&gt;selves&lt;/em&gt; (and I mean self in the psychological sense), we will reach a higher plane of reason. This higher plane will disturb our systems and structures (as it has done for many decades now… what is populism, how is populism, why is populism?), but these oscillations will level out and settle towards an imminent existence. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- my dream is to apply neural organizational principles to understanding how people/groups organize
like applying natural structure to human structure

this structure is the system-- i'm worried because i don't want to invest because it's a system that perpetuates oppression and inequality 

this is the structure, this is the framework in which decisions are made. the anatomy of the brain is not static. it changes genetically, over evolutionary time scales, and the functional goings-on changes on many faster time scales of various length  --&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

what is pre-screen society? apart from metaphors, how has our experience changed?

I met two film students, they were excited to think that their form, as opposed to the scientific mode, was held in equal esteem. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

the differences between how and why and what in neuroscience 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

how did google grow? first a tech, then decision to use ads 

have to change how people think— metaphors and paradigms of thinking e.g. OO operating system? interacting objects with files, etc? each project is a module?

  &lt;p&gt;I’m rapping cause I’m hungry and my father’s not here and they don’t want me doing this. I’m only doing it because I wanna be on stage, and my mother wants me on stage, she’d kick my ass if I wasn’t. We need every nickel and dime. Shit, we might get kicked out of the house right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We always had food stamps, food stamps is what we need. Some people don’t need em. But if food stamps weren’t there, I couldn’t be rapping. I gotta provide for my family. Babies gotta eat, G. It’s real. That’s how I’m standing, my momma fed me. We need food stamps, Government! Fuck Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ssir.org/articles/entry/using_story_to_change_systems&quot;&gt;story for change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] tackling problems like climate change, inequality, and health care requires a systems approach. The work of systems change involves seeing systemically—looking at the elements, interconnections, and wider purposes of systems—and acting systemically. Story plays a vital role in helping us do both of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Story has many different qualities that make it useful for the work of systems change. It’s a direct route to our emotions, and therefore important to decision-making. It creates meaning out of patterns. It coheres communities. It engenders empathy across difference. It enables the possible to feel probable in ways our rational minds can’t comprehend. When it comes to changing the values, mindsets, rules, and goals of a system, story is foundational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one thing to remember in this story as light, story as glue, story as web is that these same tools can (and are) used all the time for detrimental purposes, to alter oppressive narratives to adapt to new alternatives. narratives are only positive if they are conversations, not lectures…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Any large-scale human cooperation—whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe—is rooted in common myths that only exist in people’s collective imagination.” &lt;br /&gt; -Yuval Noah Harari&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Change the personal narratives we have about our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Change the cultural narratives that frame the issues we advocate for.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Change the mythic narratives that influence our worldview.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ssir.org/articles/entry/solving_the_worlds_biggest_problems_better_philanthropy_through_systems_cha&quot;&gt;systems thinking for large-scale change:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Think in systems. Having a great idea for solving a social problem is just the beginning. You also need to identify the collaborators who can help you translate your innovation into real solutions for the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Engage in research and analysis to hone your strategy. Figure out what’s really needed—and what works.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Understand that effective communication is the lifeblood of any systems change campaign. Maintain transparent and compelling communications both internally with collaborative partners, and externally with public audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Embrace your inner policy wonk—and your inner politico. If you seek to change a complex system, you will often need to change the laws, administrative rules, and official practices governing that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Measure and evaluate. Then measure and evaluate again. The most successful systems change campaigns create consistent and ongoing data assessments, and rely upon those findings to guide strategy and ensure accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m thinking about communalism and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_kinship&quot;&gt;milk kinship&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating example of the embodied politic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Noble offspring were often sent to milk kin fosterers that would foster them to maturity so that the children would be raised by their successive status subordinates. The purpose of this was for political importance to build milk kin as bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/corporate-mentorship-programs/528927/&quot;&gt;why doesn’t mentoring work?&lt;/a&gt; from the atlantic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are many problems with the existing model of corporate mentorship, says Jennifer Labin, the principal partner of TERP Associates, a firm that specializes in creating public- and private-sector mentoring programs. “Mentoring programs have become this band-aid,” Labin says. She adds that, in her experience, programs are often “thrown together by overworked, overwhelmed people who’ve never built mentoring programs.” Many people in these roles have often never even been mentored themselves, according to Labin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the book Intelligent Mentoring, by Audrey Murrell, Sheila Forte-Trammel, and Diana Bing, the authors assert that the more traditional approach to mentoring—in which an older (and often white and male) senior employee chooses a younger (and often white and male) protégé to take beneath his wing—is outdated. The main reason this is the case is that one-on-one mentoring was pioneered during a time when it was normal for people to stay in the same full-time job, at the same organization, for years—if not their entire career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have established that negative mentoring experiences caused more intense emotional and behavioral responses among employees compared to positive incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…it’s hard to fix mentoring programs if employers don’t ask for feedback and employees don’t tell them what’s wrong. And that may be the case in many places. When I reached out to a group of elite, professional women about their experiences with workplace-based mentoring, hardly anyone volunteered to share stories on the record, for fear of professional blowback. One woman simply wrote, “Try to avoid formal programs at all costs. Torture.” The key to creating better mentorship programs, Labin said, is to be more thoughtful in the planning stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
