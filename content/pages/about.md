I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islington" target="_new">islington, london</a> and go on lots of <a href="http://spewil.github.io/pictures/" target="_new">adventures</a>.

I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moultrie,_Georgia" target="_new">moultrie, georgia</a> and worked on <a href="http://epicturious.tumblr.com/post/106929958473/gus-the-bus-moultrie" target="_new">cool cars</a>.

I went to MIT where I studied mechanical engineering and film theory.

I <a href="http://google.com/patents/WO2016111785A1?cl=da" target="_new">made cool stuff</a> with awesome people in the <a href = "http://cba.mit.edu/" target="_new">center for bits and atoms</a>.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis in the <a href = "http://web.mit.edu/endlab/" target="_new">MIT nonlinear dynamics lab</a> about internal waves.

I was awarded a <a href="https://www.marshallscholarship.org/" target="_new">Marshall Scholarship</a> for two years of study in the UK. I wrote a master's thesis at <a href = "http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/advancedstructures/research.html" target="_new">Cambridge</a> about the mathematics of origami. I wrote another master's thesis at <a href = "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones/research.html" target="
_new">Imperial</a> about control theory in random networks.

I'm currently a phd student at the <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/swc" target="_new">sainsbury wellcome center</a>. I'm using reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction to understand how brains solve high-dimensional coordination problems.

Among many other projects.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to reach out.
