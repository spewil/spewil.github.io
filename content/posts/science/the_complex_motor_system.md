What got me into neuroscience was reading *Melanie Mitchell's Complexity: A Guided Tour*. 

I'd like to present a short history of motor control, showcasing the immense complexity packed into the human body used to generate robust behavior. This complex system is a guiding light, a perfect case study (in my opinion) for thinking about other natural and artificial complex systems.
