#the poetics of work# 

imagine the following individuals, one at a time. what do they do every day? is it even fair to call the following words *individuals*? is that an ethical synecdoche (is it ever?)? 

*garbage man 
*middle school football coach 
*train engineer 
*high school history teacher 
*dry cleaner 

the idea is to take these mundane objects and abstract them into objects of philosophy-- map their intricacies to those of philosophic concepts such as morality, faith, determinism, ... , and meaning.   

the question posed is, simply, "what *are* these professions?"-- we are quick to forget that students sit in boxes and scratch minerals against tree bark while someone with an electronically amplified voice yells a complex framework of symbologies at them. they, desperately, try to keep up-- their lives may truly depend on it, or (at least) so they think. 

what does a garbage man do? what does a train engineer think about their profession? semantically this may prove difficult; our discussion could quickly devolve into a mess of *custodial services* and *waste managements*. this can be mitigated, though, by discipline of vocabulary-- just a like a #real# philosopher would show! which leads to my chief concern: i hope this doesn't sound like "pop" philosophy (a nice word for pseudophilosophy). i want to approach philosophical discourse like i've tried to approach everything else: with a clear, open mind, a search for the purest (ideal) truth of the matter. let's try: 

what is a job? what is work? there is a physical explanation, there are emotional explanations, there are anthropological definitions. letâ€™s discuss this first, then move into examples, for if math class has taught me anything it's that high-minded discussion will only get us so far. we need some substrate. we need to not only become a football coach, a dry cleaner, we need to become a philosopher-*X*: a philosopher-coach, a philosopher-cleaner... we must approach a profession not as a moniker or a label or a placeholder, but as a human being undergoing work (first in the sense of Russell, towards the development of our own theory).   

why? 

ok. sure. because as the current generation, my generation, moves into "choosing" a career (or not, as it were), there is a necessary and lacking explication of what it means to work. let's put on some different hats. let's rediscover work.
