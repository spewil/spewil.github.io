#made or discovered?  
##and other fundamental dualities  

Royce writes of Nietzsche's übermensch  

>Whether you discuss the philosophy of Nietzsche or of mathematics,--whether the *Umwertang aller Werte* or the "class of all classes,"--whether Mr. Russell's "Contradiction" or the *übermensch* in question,...always the same general issue has sooner or later to be faced. You are involved in some phase of the problem about the nature of truth.< 

*the nature of truth*. i add to Mr. Royce's remark "of Nietzsche or of mathematics"-- or of literature or of poetry or of engineering or of art. every human being, in my mind, is working towards their own understanding of Truth. this, in effect, is our Truth. our story, our myth, our memory and our creation transcends physicality and embodies meaning. the difficulty becomes when the content (what a rubbish word, but fitting here) is vapid. like this very page. 

Ratner-Rosenhagen summarizes Royce's thoughts in her own remark

>Thus, the individualistic strain in transatlantic instrumentalism viewed truth as something made, not found, and as relative to the individual.< 

the debate becomes another duality-- Platonic vs Aristotelian-- "this tension between relativism and individualism," she writes. are these dualities themselves manufactured or naturally occurring, are they plastic or are they mineral? 

nature vs. nurture etc etc. i'm more concerned with how we count things and why we can only count to two and three and not seven or twelve. 

my belief, currently, is that this mining/making collapses after the emergence (i don't use that word in a technical sense here) of human consciousness. if we, for a second, believe that consciousness is in fact the product of some sort of phase transition, is it impossible to imagine a similar occurrence on a much longer time scale? i mean to say that pre-human / pre-anthro / ante-homo / whatever and after is the only fundamental duality-- historicism must in fact rule under this idea seeing as it is only time that decides the existence of human thought. 

this is muddled, of course. so, you say, everything post-homo is manufactured by the human mind? no. so, then, everything is purely naturalistic without room for any quantum-mojo letting things swerve around... again, i say no. 

while i do think of the universe as purely natural, the idea i'm pondering here is the feedback loop between nature and humanity. it's fair to say that things are manufactured without giving into the concept of a ethereal soul. right? we send a man to the moon, we create artificial biologies. we tamper, we muddle, we mess. i'm not waxing humanistic, i'm arguing that once consciousness exists on a global scale, this is some sort of "singularity" moment. we can no longer, after this point in biological history, think of man and nature as a single system, but of two systems in simultaneity.

this approach in thinking about the evolution of man and nature, i believe, will aid in predicting trends and patterns coinciding the development of advanced technology. following Nietzsche, we believe in a manufactured Truth, Truth as Aristotelian object, something created subjectively as a placeholder for belief. how does this feedback system behave for the development of Truth?
