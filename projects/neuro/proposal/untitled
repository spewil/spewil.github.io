reads like a laundry list 

keep the list to three key things 

intro: sets up an outline 

structure is lacking (flow)

1. building objects and things that improve people's lives 
2. interactions/emotions with the world/objects and how to control it
3. artificial feedback loops 
4. personal ethics / happiness

substance/absence doesn't relate ?

duality of poetic sense and hard engineering sense now applied to this problem -- stress or cut back 

better informed 
enhancing ability
