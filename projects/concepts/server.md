there is a lot of worry about who owns and uses our data-- for good reason. companies buy and sell our personal data, and this practice is quickly becoming a sort of technocratic supercapitalism. i believe that looking back, this will be as hard to understand as steel and newspaper monopolies of the early 20th century. 

there are many tools available to help protect yourself from have your personal information farmed and traded as wampum. for instance [this](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [this](http://www.myusbcloud.com/). 

my concept is similar to the second link. imagine a small piece of hardware that acts locally to store all of your data that you can access through a dropbox-like capability. this way, you know where all of your data is at all times, and you know where it isn't. you can run your email, your website, and all of those things from your home. the goal is privacy and control. apple has a [thing](https://www.apple.com/uk/airport-extreme/); it's too expensive, not cross-platform, and not customizable. because it's apple. 

of course, this is moving back to an earlier internet. but maybe that's not such a bad thing?
