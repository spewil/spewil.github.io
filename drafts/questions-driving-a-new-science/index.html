  <p>Some questions were posed on the New Science website, and I thought I'd take a crack at a few of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How exactly do various philanthropic organizations in the life sciences space work? How do they impact the ecosystem, and how do they succeed and fail at facilitating the pursuit of great research? How much counterfactual impact do they make?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can grad students and postdocs pursue higher variance research portfolios while not jeopardizing their long-term career prospects?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MIT UROP
Untethered fellowships
fully funded PhD
what next? want to exit academia but continue doing science (what does this mean?)</p>
<ul>
<li>How can people from technical backgrounds (software engineers, physicists, mathematicians) interested in but with little formal training in biology meaningfully contribute to research projects? How to pair them with interested grad students, postdocs and PIs to get them started in research and to bring them to the frontier?</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk about Sania, Dev Effect brokering a deal. It's really about enabling these people and lowering the risk of these engagements, making sure people are smart enough and experienced enough to make them fruitful for everyone involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to further enable and systematize the work of people who do error correction and fraud detection in science like Elisabeth Bik and James Heathers? Notably, they both left academia academia because at the moment thereâ€™s no place in science for people who, you know, correct errors in scientific literature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are universities so averse to hiring co-PIs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the NIH actually work?
What could be the equity analog of scientific research decades away from commercialization?</p>
</li>
</ul>
