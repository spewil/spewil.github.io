Hi, I'm spencer.



I'm an engineer and a scientist too.

Currently a phd student at the <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/swc" target="_new">sainsbury wellcome center</a>, I'm using reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction to understand how brains solve high-dimensional coordination problems. 

Feel free to reach out.
